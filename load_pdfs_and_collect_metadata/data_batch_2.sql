In 2024, CCOs face heightened demands from regulators and enforcement agencies for program effectiveness,
with many in the U.S. also facing an expanded duty of oversight. They must meet these demands all while
navigating increasing risk management volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity — “VUCA” — across the

CCOs tell us they spend significant effort reviewing KRIs — key risk events and other risk hot spots — to evaluate
their compliance program performance. Yet, despite those investments, there’s little correlation between effort
expended here and CCO confidence in program effectiveness.

Our research shows that those CCOs who evaluate their programs according to a defined set of performance indicators or quality standards
have the highest confidence in their program effectiveness.
Based on our many years of cross-functional research, we’ve highlighted nine quality standards that impact program performance.
Our research shows that employees are 139% more likely to understand and prioritize compliance when quality

Trends Impacting CCOs in 2024
In 2024, CCOs face heightened demands from regulators and enforcement agencies for program effectiveness,
with many in the U.S. also facing an expanded duty of oversight. They must meet these demands all while
navigating increasing risk management volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity — “VUCA” — across the
organization and the extended enterprise.

Challenge: Significant Effort Spent on KRIs
CCOs tell us they spend significant effort reviewing KRIs — key risk events and other risk hot spots — to evaluate
their compliance program performance. Yet, despite those investments, there’s little correlation between effort
expended here and CCO confidence in program effectiveness.

Imperative: Develop and Assess Quality Standards
Our research shows that those CCOs who evaluate their programs according to a defined set of performance indicators or quality standards
have the highest confidence in their program effectiveness.
Based on our many years of cross-functional research, we’ve highlighted nine quality standards that impact program performance.
Our research shows that employees are 139% more likely to understand and prioritize compliance when quality

Organizational Resilience
Few organizations make organizational resilience a strategic priority with executive sponsorship, leaving them
vulnerable to more frequent and costly disruptive events. Efforts to develop and operationalize resilience
capabilities are often hindered by talent scarcity, lack of organizational awareness and limited funding. Resilience
efforts will likely be further strained as organizations cut costs. Continuing to underinvest in resilience capabilities
increases the fragility of the organization when inevitable disruptions hit.

2024年中国能源经济指数研究及展望
当前，国内经济在疫情防控平稳转段后进入全新发展阶段。国际
局势错综复杂，气候影响持续波动，能源经济发展受到多重外部因素
干扰，国家能源安全保障形势复杂。同时，在“双碳”目标与碳排放
“双控”的政策方针下，国内碳减排工作紧锣密鼓地推进，企业低碳
活动与全国碳交易日益活跃，进一步给能源行业的转型发展带来挑战
与机遇。在多元的国内外宏观环境变动下，能源经济发展需要充分发
挥稳投资、促增长的重要作用，实现能源更加安全、更加绿色、更加
高效地发展，为我国经济社会发展提供坚实的能源保障。为应对能源
经济与能源行业发展格局及业内个体运营的多维度演变，北京理工大
学能源与环境政策研究中心自2020年开始连续发布中国能源经济指
数，对各个能源子行业的宏观、中观以及微观表现进行监测，并对能
源经济发展未来走向进行预测。
一、能源经济指数范围界定与指标体系
我国的能源行业规模庞大，覆盖面广，发展受到技术、政策、市
场等多方面影响，各个能源子行业之间因存在客观的自然禀赋差异而
面临不尽相同的行业瓶颈与发展困难。于是在中央战略部署下，各个
能源子行业落实着宏观、中观、微观上的差异化发展战略。为此，CEEP
中国能源经济指数捕捉行业差异，全面考察不同能源类型与能源产业
链，不仅包括煤炭、石油和天然气等传统能源，而且囊括风电、光伏、
生物质能等可再生能源及其基础组件，同时考虑电网自控设备、新能
1
源汽车等新兴能源集成和利用产业，最终整合成为如图 1 所示的能源
行业子行业的广义产业链条。
图1 能源行业分类
为了能源经济指数兼具全面性与现实说服力，本研究在建立能源
经济相关的综合评价体系时，确定系统性、典型性、层次性、科学性、
可比性五大原则进行子指标筛选与体系构建，从长远的宏观经济周期、
全面的产业运转考量和具体的企业运营表现三个层次，宏、中、微观
层层递进地分析中国能源经济综合表现，具体指标体系如图 1 所示。
宏观经济环境方面综合了国内经济状况与国际贸易情况，较为完整地
刻画了宏观经济运行；中观行业层面则以政策支持为支点，分别对行
业供需情况与行业高质量发展情况进行考察，以明确各行业间的核心
发展差异；微观层面则纳入了各行业能源子行业的企业个体情况，通
过股票指数中的绝对量变化以及财务绩效中体现的结构性变化，确保
2
指标体系的科学性与可比性。
图2 能源经济指数指标体系框架
二、能源经济指数功能与价值
指数在宏观角度展现了宏观经济与能源经济之间的密切关联与
相互作用，从中观角度表示了能源行业自身所受的政策影响以及内部
高质量转型态势和行业供需变动，从微观角度指征了能源行业内部的
企业个体运转情况，尤其是金融财务表现。因此，本指数既可以帮助
政府把握能源行业的综合运行情况，协助政策方向的把控；又可以帮
助金融市场的参与者发现能源行业在全新的高质量发展方针下所诞
生的投资机遇，评估行业与企业的投资价值；还能够识别能源企业运
营风险，及时纠偏，回归行业总体走势；最后，通过短期预测能够给
予能源行业参与者长远策略制定的参考依据，规避潜在的行业波动，
3
捕捉行业未来动向。
能源经济指数是一个功能丰富的评估工具，可以从宏观、中观和
微观三个角度全面评估中国能源经济的综合表现。指数根据当期和历
史得分判断能源经济整体处于经济循环周期的波峰或波谷，还能够刻
画能源经济与宏观经济二者的内部关联。通过能源子行业得分，可以
筛选综合表现相对靠前的行业，聚焦行业投资关注点，一方面纵向对
比历史情况，发现进步较大的行业，另一方面横向从细分维度分析其
发展经验。通过拆解六大指标得分，则可以详细分析行业在不同维度
的发展表现，对能源子行业的状况有更深度的把握。最后，通过对指
数的短期预测与情景预测，能够预估潜在的行业变动与不同外部因素
影响情景下，我国能源经济的差异化变动情况。
三、能源经济所受的外部因素影响
从能源经济与我国经济社会环境的总体特点出发，结合《关于完
善能源绿色低碳转型体制机制和政策措施的意见》等关键政策文件以
及《努力提高金融体系气候风险管理能力》等业内专家文章，可以确
定能源经济会受到国际上的地缘政治风险、国内减排工作进展以及客
观气候因素变化带来的外部影响。首先，在减排工作方面，当前能源
经济的主体政策方针是在加速构建清洁低碳、安全高效的能源体系下，
打造绿色发展的能源经济体系，因此包括全国碳交易与企业自发低碳
行为在内的各类碳减排工作有所推进，会加强能源行业的自主性与抗
风险能力，同时拉升能源经济增长。而后，国际动荡局势导致能源经
4
济发展面临进出口受阻、技术壁垒等诸多挑战，一旦地缘政治风险加
剧，能源经济也将遭受牵连，发展受到抑制。最后，能源经济绿色转
型过程中，供应稳定的高碳能源行业会被低碳行业逐渐取代，但在完
全解决这些低碳行业的持续供应难题前，突发的气候问题会成为导火
索，触发转型过程的潜在供应风险，致使出现能源安全危机，因此当
常规性的气候因素出现反常、极端天气事件增多时，转型中的能源经
济发展容易遭受打击。本研究后续通过情景预测的方式，分析以上三
种因素对能源经济发展未来趋势的潜在影响。
图3 能源经济所受到的外部因素影响
四、能源经济指数编制方法及情景预测方法
CEEP 中国能源经济指数以 2015 年第一季度为基期，每季度更
新一次指数数据。指数合成计算的基础数据均从官方发布和公开数据
库获得。指数计算时首先进行标准化处理；而后，通过主成分分析法、
5
加权平均法等获取各个能源子行业的各个一级指标得分，其中在量化
政策支持部分为尽可能消除主观性影响，引入 TF-IDF 机器学习算法
完成政策关键词分析，再进行词汇匹配，进而进行政策打分；再根据
实际情况，探讨各个行业内部各个指标的具体表现与内在作用机理，
通过参考相关领域的经典研究工作并采访领域内专家学者来确定权
重，加权计算各个行业的行业能源经济表现；进一步综合各个能源子
行业的能源经济指数，进行归一计算，得到 CEEP 中国能源经济指数
结果；最后，通过单变量时序预测对 2024 年全年的短期能源经济指
数情况进行预测。
而在考虑外部影响因素的情景预测方面，引入基于粒子群优化算
法改进的长短时记忆模型（PSO-LSTM 模型）展开多输入单输出的回
归预测。在碳减排工作量化方面，使用全国碳交易额与基于文本分析
的企业低碳指数进行合成；在国际局势量化方面，使用地缘政治风险
指数进行表征；在气候因素量化方面，纳入了温度、降水等常规因素
与极端天气事件次数这一突发因素。通过对未来 2024 年、2025 年设
定不同的变量变化情况，确定不同的能源经济发展外部情景，经过历
史数据训练后，将输入变量导入模型即可得到未来不同情景中能源经
济指数的潜在情况。

五、能源经济指数结果分析
（一）能源经济指数已成长为经济回升的强心剂
能源经济指数与宏观经济的历史与预测走势图显示（见图 5），能
源经济指数走势与宏观经济关系密切，近年蓬勃发展，定位从宏观经
济抵御风险的缓冲带，逐渐成长为经济回升的强心剂。自 2020 年能
源经济开始回暖后，能源经济经历了连续四年的回升期：初期在宏观
经济高速回升的带动下，脱离最低点，稳步向好；至 2021 年第一季
度回归历史平均水平而后，宏观经济出现下行，能源经济凭借自身在
疫情与后疫情时代的发展必要性，和双碳目标下的发展紧迫性，与宏
观经济角色转换，成为宏观经济的缓冲带。而截至 2023 年第四季度，
能源经济波动上升，达到历史最高水平，能源经济指数与 2017 年第
四季度间呈现双峰形态，在现阶段国内经济挑战丛生的大背景下成为

（二）2023 年第 4 季度高创新行业与保供主力军齐头并进
通过对比当期各个能源行业的能源经济指数，能够确定每个季度
能源子行业的能源经济综合发展情况，展开行业间的横向比较。本报
告以 2023 年第 4 季度得分由高到低将能源子行业归为四个梯队，同
时展示了其历史得分曲线（见图 6）。
在 2018 年到 2023 年期间，风光行业持续走强，领军能源经济发
展，而电网自控设备作为能源消纳的优质搭档，发展水平也名列前茅，
三大高创新行业形成可再生能源与能源消纳两大板块的协同有机发
展态势，高效的同时做出减排贡献。
在经历 2022 年末的能源供应问题后，煤炭生产销售与火力发电
两个行业相较于上一年度排名继续升高，已进入第一梯队与第二梯队，
传统能源行业转型路线从供应削减，逐步重塑为高质量发展路线，兼
顾减排与保供，凸显当前能源自主性与供应安全的重要性。
此外，光伏设备和风电设备在风光发电高速发展的情况下，势头
8
却有所回落，这印证了我国风光方面的可再生能源布局初具成效，从
大规模建设向大规模应用迈进。
图6 2018-2023年能源行业经济指数及2023年第4季度行业优势梯队
（三）维持稳定性和提升自主性是能源行业发展主旋律
为了明确 2023 年相比于 2022 年哪些能源子行业取得进步及其
进步原因，对 2023 年各子行业政策支持、行业供需以及行业高质量
的得分与 2022 年同期进行对比，得到行业提升榜。（见图 7）。
相较于 2022 年，2023 年政策重心进一步落在能源的安全保供
9
上，火力发电与煤炭生产销售所获政策支持力度得到加强，且二者
随着高质量发展的成效显现，在技术革新、结构调整下兼顾了减排
与供应，其他行业层面指标也有一定进步。两个行业近年来重新占
据行业优势地位显现出能源经济发展历程中，维持能源稳定供应是
近年来的发展重点。而在摆脱疫情影响后，新能源汽车销量回升，
资金流的扩大也带动新能源车电池研发投入增加。水力发电在经历
了供应危机后，行业内意识到能源安全重要性，加强了稳定性技术
的攻关。生物质能应用随着各类多联产项目的运营，应用模式创
新，技术稳定性提高，产量与应用量都得以改善。

（四）碳减排有望成为能源经济防护罩与推进器
本研究参考国际形势黄皮书、国家气候中心历年发文、IPCC 报
告、生态环境部发文等，结合经典研究文献，设置了地缘政治、气
候因素、碳减排工作进展等不同外部因素的变化参数，最终形成了
三个情景，即风险暴露情景，风险对抗情景与相对乐观情景，同时
设定了不考虑外部因素影响的单变量时序预测情景作为参照序列
（见图 8）。
图8 能源经济指数外部因素影响下的预测情景
11
根据不同情景，将变量输入到预测模型中后，得到对应的情景预
测结果（见图 9）。碳减排工作的加速展开，在负面因素稳定的恰当时
机具备 21%的理论能源经济助力，能够将能源经济指数水平抬升一
个台阶。积极乐观情景与风险暴露情景之间存在的差异，显现了碳减
排工作本身对能源经济最大拉升潜力空间可达 37%，可见进一步加
速碳减排工作推进对于能源经济的提升仍具有较高的边际效用。加速
推进碳减排工作落实可抵御 12%剧烈外部风险，保证即便面对恶劣
环境，能源经济依旧可以维持历史水平。
总结来看，一方面碳减排工作可以有效增强能源系统风险抗性，
是能源经济的“防护罩”，另一方面进一步加速碳减排工作可实现较
大的能源经济提升效果，是能源经济的“推进器”。
图9 2024-2025年能源经济指数情景预测
（五）2024 年高创新行业和保供行业是年度投资较优选择
由于外部因素变化不确定性较大，对分行业短时预测时产生的趋
势影响又不明确，因此第（五）、（六）节针对 2024 年年度行业指数
的预测分析采用不考虑外部影响的时序预测结果。
预计 2024 年各个子行业发展趋势不会出现过大波动，风光发电
12
等高创新行业是年度投资热点，传统化石能源行业作为保供行业居于
前列，二者的共同繁荣显现出 2024 年我国能源行业主力间的平稳接
棒（见图 10）。摆脱低迷的消费环境后，新能源汽车行业在需求复苏
的情况下，预计 2024 年是回升期，可尽早投资，进行长期规划。而
生物质能、水力发电以及核能发电在 2017 年的发展势头后未能找到
合适的长期发展战略，应当尽快摸清行业增长点，实现发展复苏。
图10 2024年年度能源行业投资热点预测
（六）2024 年能源企业供需与高质量水平是投资选择风向标
根据能源企业历史得分分布，采用四分位法将每个年度的指标
表现分为高热、偏热、正常和偏冷 4 个等级，根据短期预测结果，
预估 2024 年年度各个能源子行业企业的基本面表现。
2024 年年度能源企业在供需和高质量水平方面表现强劲，依靠
二者发展驱动，基本面表现热度已回归高水平（见图 11）。虽然在
宏观经济调整期，各企业运营表现都出现波动，股票指数相比于去
年同阶段下滑；但总体上能源经济并未受到影响，仍在逐步攀升，
证明当前能源企业的高质量发展初具成效，在稳定的供需保障下，
企业基本面水平很难出现下滑。
13
在优质投资企业的选择原因上，风光发电企业受政策支持力度
大，高质量发展水平持续走强，随着风电、光电已进入大规模应用
阶段，该类企业成为短期投资的热点之一；天然气、煤炭生产销售
企业供需与高质量水平达近年峰值，已逐渐找到企业发展均衡点，
作为能源行业高质量发展的主力军，是合适的投资选择；而新能源
汽车上、中游产业链的相关企业随着消费复苏，供需回归历史平均
水平，资金链的充实增加企业研发投入，带动高质量水平上涨，未
来发展可期，可做长期投资布局。总结来看，在进行投资选择时，
能源企业供需与高质量水平是投资者的风向标。

2024年中国能源经济指数研究及展望
当前，国内经济在疫情防控平稳转段后进入全新发展阶段。国际
局势错综复杂，气候影响持续波动，能源经济发展受到多重外部因素
干扰，国家能源安全保障形势复杂。同时，在“双碳”目标与碳排放
“双控”的政策方针下，国内碳减排工作紧锣密鼓地推进，企业低碳
活动与全国碳交易日益活跃，进一步给能源行业的转型发展带来挑战
与机遇。在多元的国内外宏观环境变动下，能源经济发展需要充分发
挥稳投资、促增长的重要作用，实现能源更加安全、更加绿色、更加
高效地发展，为我国经济社会发展提供坚实的能源保障。为应对能源
经济与能源行业发展格局及业内个体运营的多维度演变，北京理工大
学能源与环境政策研究中心自2020年开始连续发布中国能源经济指
数，对各个能源子行业的宏观、中观以及微观表现进行监测，并对能
源经济发展未来走向进行预测。
一、能源经济指数范围界定与指标体系
我国的能源行业规模庞大，覆盖面广，发展受到技术、政策、市
场等多方面影响，各个能源子行业之间因存在客观的自然禀赋差异而
面临不尽相同的行业瓶颈与发展困难。于是在中央战略部署下，各个
能源子行业落实着宏观、中观、微观上的差异化发展战略。为此，CEEP
中国能源经济指数捕捉行业差异，全面考察不同能源类型与能源产业
链，不仅包括煤炭、石油和天然气等传统能源，而且囊括风电、光伏、
生物质能等可再生能源及其基础组件，同时考虑电网自控设备、新能
1
源汽车等新兴能源集成和利用产业，最终整合成为如图 1 所示的能源
行业子行业的广义产业链条。
图1 能源行业分类
为了能源经济指数兼具全面性与现实说服力，本研究在建立能源
经济相关的综合评价体系时，确定系统性、典型性、层次性、科学性、
可比性五大原则进行子指标筛选与体系构建，从长远的宏观经济周期、
全面的产业运转考量和具体的企业运营表现三个层次，宏、中、微观
层层递进地分析中国能源经济综合表现，具体指标体系如图 1 所示。
宏观经济环境方面综合了国内经济状况与国际贸易情况，较为完整地
刻画了宏观经济运行；中观行业层面则以政策支持为支点，分别对行
业供需情况与行业高质量发展情况进行考察，以明确各行业间的核心
发展差异；微观层面则纳入了各行业能源子行业的企业个体情况，通
过股票指数中的绝对量变化以及财务绩效中体现的结构性变化，确保
2
指标体系的科学性与可比性。
图2 能源经济指数指标体系框架
二、能源经济指数功能与价值
指数在宏观角度展现了宏观经济与能源经济之间的密切关联与
相互作用，从中观角度表示了能源行业自身所受的政策影响以及内部
高质量转型态势和行业供需变动，从微观角度指征了能源行业内部的
企业个体运转情况，尤其是金融财务表现。因此，本指数既可以帮助
政府把握能源行业的综合运行情况，协助政策方向的把控；又可以帮
助金融市场的参与者发现能源行业在全新的高质量发展方针下所诞
生的投资机遇，评估行业与企业的投资价值；还能够识别能源企业运
营风险，及时纠偏，回归行业总体走势；最后，通过短期预测能够给
予能源行业参与者长远策略制定的参考依据，规避潜在的行业波动，
3
捕捉行业未来动向。
能源经济指数是一个功能丰富的评估工具，可以从宏观、中观和
微观三个角度全面评估中国能源经济的综合表现。指数根据当期和历
史得分判断能源经济整体处于经济循环周期的波峰或波谷，还能够刻
画能源经济与宏观经济二者的内部关联。通过能源子行业得分，可以
筛选综合表现相对靠前的行业，聚焦行业投资关注点，一方面纵向对
比历史情况，发现进步较大的行业，另一方面横向从细分维度分析其
发展经验。通过拆解六大指标得分，则可以详细分析行业在不同维度
的发展表现，对能源子行业的状况有更深度的把握。最后，通过对指
数的短期预测与情景预测，能够预估潜在的行业变动与不同外部因素
影响情景下，我国能源经济的差异化变动情况。
三、能源经济所受的外部因素影响
从能源经济与我国经济社会环境的总体特点出发，结合《关于完
善能源绿色低碳转型体制机制和政策措施的意见》等关键政策文件以
及《努力提高金融体系气候风险管理能力》等业内专家文章，可以确
定能源经济会受到国际上的地缘政治风险、国内减排工作进展以及客
观气候因素变化带来的外部影响。首先，在减排工作方面，当前能源
经济的主体政策方针是在加速构建清洁低碳、安全高效的能源体系下，
打造绿色发展的能源经济体系，因此包括全国碳交易与企业自发低碳
行为在内的各类碳减排工作有所推进，会加强能源行业的自主性与抗
风险能力，同时拉升能源经济增长。而后，国际动荡局势导致能源经
4
济发展面临进出口受阻、技术壁垒等诸多挑战，一旦地缘政治风险加
剧，能源经济也将遭受牵连，发展受到抑制。最后，能源经济绿色转
型过程中，供应稳定的高碳能源行业会被低碳行业逐渐取代，但在完
全解决这些低碳行业的持续供应难题前，突发的气候问题会成为导火
索，触发转型过程的潜在供应风险，致使出现能源安全危机，因此当
常规性的气候因素出现反常、极端天气事件增多时，转型中的能源经
济发展容易遭受打击。本研究后续通过情景预测的方式，分析以上三
种因素对能源经济发展未来趋势的潜在影响。
图3 能源经济所受到的外部因素影响
四、能源经济指数编制方法及情景预测方法
CEEP 中国能源经济指数以 2015 年第一季度为基期，每季度更
新一次指数数据。指数合成计算的基础数据均从官方发布和公开数据
库获得。指数计算时首先进行标准化处理；而后，通过主成分分析法、
5
加权平均法等获取各个能源子行业的各个一级指标得分，其中在量化
政策支持部分为尽可能消除主观性影响，引入 TF-IDF 机器学习算法
完成政策关键词分析，再进行词汇匹配，进而进行政策打分；再根据
实际情况，探讨各个行业内部各个指标的具体表现与内在作用机理，
通过参考相关领域的经典研究工作并采访领域内专家学者来确定权
重，加权计算各个行业的行业能源经济表现；进一步综合各个能源子
行业的能源经济指数，进行归一计算，得到 CEEP 中国能源经济指数
结果；最后，通过单变量时序预测对 2024 年全年的短期能源经济指
数情况进行预测。
而在考虑外部影响因素的情景预测方面，引入基于粒子群优化算
法改进的长短时记忆模型（PSO-LSTM 模型）展开多输入单输出的回
归预测。在碳减排工作量化方面，使用全国碳交易额与基于文本分析
的企业低碳指数进行合成；在国际局势量化方面，使用地缘政治风险
指数进行表征；在气候因素量化方面，纳入了温度、降水等常规因素
与极端天气事件次数这一突发因素。通过对未来 2024 年、2025 年设
定不同的变量变化情况，确定不同的能源经济发展外部情景，经过历
史数据训练后，将输入变量导入模型即可得到未来不同情景中能源经
济指数的潜在情况。

图4 基于PSO-LSTM的能源经济指数走势情景预测
五、能源经济指数结果分析
（一）能源经济指数已成长为经济回升的强心剂
能源经济指数与宏观经济的历史与预测走势图显示（见图 5），能
源经济指数走势与宏观经济关系密切，近年蓬勃发展，定位从宏观经
济抵御风险的缓冲带，逐渐成长为经济回升的强心剂。自 2020 年能
源经济开始回暖后，能源经济经历了连续四年的回升期：初期在宏观
经济高速回升的带动下，脱离最低点，稳步向好；至 2021 年第一季
度回归历史平均水平而后，宏观经济出现下行，能源经济凭借自身在
疫情与后疫情时代的发展必要性，和双碳目标下的发展紧迫性，与宏
观经济角色转换，成为宏观经济的缓冲带。而截至 2023 年第四季度，
能源经济波动上升，达到历史最高水平，能源经济指数与 2017 年第
四季度间呈现双峰形态，在现阶段国内经济挑战丛生的大背景下成为
7
了宏观经济回升的强心剂。
图5 能源经济与宏观经济指数走势
（二）2023 年第 4 季度高创新行业与保供主力军齐头并进
通过对比当期各个能源行业的能源经济指数，能够确定每个季度
能源子行业的能源经济综合发展情况，展开行业间的横向比较。本报
告以 2023 年第 4 季度得分由高到低将能源子行业归为四个梯队，同
时展示了其历史得分曲线（见图 6）。
在 2018 年到 2023 年期间，风光行业持续走强，领军能源经济发
展，而电网自控设备作为能源消纳的优质搭档，发展水平也名列前茅，
三大高创新行业形成可再生能源与能源消纳两大板块的协同有机发
展态势，高效的同时做出减排贡献。
在经历 2022 年末的能源供应问题后，煤炭生产销售与火力发电
两个行业相较于上一年度排名继续升高，已进入第一梯队与第二梯队，
传统能源行业转型路线从供应削减，逐步重塑为高质量发展路线，兼
顾减排与保供，凸显当前能源自主性与供应安全的重要性。
此外，光伏设备和风电设备在风光发电高速发展的情况下，势头
8
却有所回落，这印证了我国风光方面的可再生能源布局初具成效，从
大规模建设向大规模应用迈进。
图6 2018-2023年能源行业经济指数及2023年第4季度行业优势梯队
（三）维持稳定性和提升自主性是能源行业发展主旋律
为了明确 2023 年相比于 2022 年哪些能源子行业取得进步及其
进步原因，对 2023 年各子行业政策支持、行业供需以及行业高质量
的得分与 2022 年同期进行对比，得到行业提升榜。（见图 7）。
相较于 2022 年，2023 年政策重心进一步落在能源的安全保供
9
上，火力发电与煤炭生产销售所获政策支持力度得到加强，且二者
随着高质量发展的成效显现，在技术革新、结构调整下兼顾了减排
与供应，其他行业层面指标也有一定进步。两个行业近年来重新占
据行业优势地位显现出能源经济发展历程中，维持能源稳定供应是
近年来的发展重点。而在摆脱疫情影响后，新能源汽车销量回升，
资金流的扩大也带动新能源车电池研发投入增加。水力发电在经历
了供应危机后，行业内意识到能源安全重要性，加强了稳定性技术
的攻关。生物质能应用随着各类多联产项目的运营，应用模式创
新，技术稳定性提高，产量与应用量都得以改善。
图7 2023年能源子行业提升榜
10
（四）碳减排有望成为能源经济防护罩与推进器
本研究参考国际形势黄皮书、国家气候中心历年发文、IPCC 报
告、生态环境部发文等，结合经典研究文献，设置了地缘政治、气
候因素、碳减排工作进展等不同外部因素的变化参数，最终形成了
三个情景，即风险暴露情景，风险对抗情景与相对乐观情景，同时
设定了不考虑外部因素影响的单变量时序预测情景作为参照序列
（见图 8）。
图8 能源经济指数外部因素影响下的预测情景
11
根据不同情景，将变量输入到预测模型中后，得到对应的情景预
测结果（见图 9）。碳减排工作的加速展开，在负面因素稳定的恰当时
机具备 21%的理论能源经济助力，能够将能源经济指数水平抬升一
个台阶。积极乐观情景与风险暴露情景之间存在的差异，显现了碳减
排工作本身对能源经济最大拉升潜力空间可达 37%，可见进一步加
速碳减排工作推进对于能源经济的提升仍具有较高的边际效用。加速
推进碳减排工作落实可抵御 12%剧烈外部风险，保证即便面对恶劣
环境，能源经济依旧可以维持历史水平。
总结来看，一方面碳减排工作可以有效增强能源系统风险抗性，
是能源经济的“防护罩”，另一方面进一步加速碳减排工作可实现较
大的能源经济提升效果，是能源经济的“推进器”。

（五）2024 年高创新行业和保供行业是年度投资较优选择
由于外部因素变化不确定性较大，对分行业短时预测时产生的趋
势影响又不明确，因此第（五）、（六）节针对 2024 年年度行业指数
的预测分析采用不考虑外部影响的时序预测结果。
预计 2024 年各个子行业发展趋势不会出现过大波动，风光发电
12
等高创新行业是年度投资热点，传统化石能源行业作为保供行业居于
前列，二者的共同繁荣显现出 2024 年我国能源行业主力间的平稳接
棒（见图 10）。摆脱低迷的消费环境后，新能源汽车行业在需求复苏
的情况下，预计 2024 年是回升期，可尽早投资，进行长期规划。而
生物质能、水力发电以及核能发电在 2017 年的发展势头后未能找到
合适的长期发展战略，应当尽快摸清行业增长点，实现发展复苏。

（六）2024 年能源企业供需与高质量水平是投资选择风向标
根据能源企业历史得分分布，采用四分位法将每个年度的指标
表现分为高热、偏热、正常和偏冷 4 个等级，根据短期预测结果，
预估 2024 年年度各个能源子行业企业的基本面表现。
2024 年年度能源企业在供需和高质量水平方面表现强劲，依靠
二者发展驱动，基本面表现热度已回归高水平（见图 11）。虽然在
宏观经济调整期，各企业运营表现都出现波动，股票指数相比于去
年同阶段下滑；但总体上能源经济并未受到影响，仍在逐步攀升，
证明当前能源企业的高质量发展初具成效，在稳定的供需保障下，
企业基本面水平很难出现下滑。
13
在优质投资企业的选择原因上，风光发电企业受政策支持力度
大，高质量发展水平持续走强，随着风电、光电已进入大规模应用
阶段，该类企业成为短期投资的热点之一；天然气、煤炭生产销售
企业供需与高质量水平达近年峰值，已逐渐找到企业发展均衡点，
作为能源行业高质量发展的主力军，是合适的投资选择；而新能源
汽车上、中游产业链的相关企业随着消费复苏，供需回归历史平均
水平，资金链的充实增加企业研发投入，带动高质量水平上涨，未
来发展可期，可做长期投资布局。总结来看，在进行投资选择时，
能源企业供需与高质量水平是投资者的风向标。

六、关键结论和建议
CEEP 中国能源经济指数捕捉能源子行业间的发展差异，从宏观
的经济运行周期、中观的产业运转情况和微观的企业运营表现，层层
深入地对中国能源经济形势和发展趋势进行解读，意在结合能源经济
内外部因素，回顾能源经济发展历程，展望能源经济未来潜在走势，
确定短期的投资热点行业与能源经济波动情况，解构能源子行业各个
层次与各个维度的全面发展状况，识别外部风险来源，锁定风险抵御
措施。主要结论与建议如下：
第一，宏观层面，能源经济成为经济回升向好的强心剂，减排工
作能有效加强能源经济抗风险能力。能源经济近年来发展复苏，逆势
而上，定位从宏观经济抵御风险的缓冲带，逐渐成长为经济回升的强
心剂。2023 年能源经济回归近年最高水平，未来发展形势积极乐观。
而在国际局势紧张多变与极端天气频发带来的负面影响之下，我国将
借力于国内碳减排工作，增强能源经济自主性与风险抗性，进而提高
能源系统安全，保证能源经济稳定运行。
第二，行业层面，高创新行业与保供主力行业处于优势地位，维
持稳定性和提升自主性是中国能源经济的发展主旋律。高创新行业与
保供主力行业的共同繁荣标志着我国能源主力行业间的平稳交接，这
也揭示了我国能源发展离不开以减排、创新工作为代表的高质量路线
的拔高与供应安全的托底。
第三，企业层面，风光发电和天然气、煤炭生产销售企业是近期
投资的优质选择；新能源汽车上、中游产业链的相关企业预计持续回
15
暖，长期投资可重点关注。其中风光发电企业在储能等稳定性技术开
发方面投入较大，可将这一方面作为重点投资方向；煤炭与天然气相
关企业随着高质量发展的成效显现，兼顾了减排与供应安全，在能源
安全的必要性下，投资者可以在近期关注；摆脱低迷的消费环境后，
新能源车整车与新能源车电池行业在需求复苏的情况下，预计 2024
年是回升期，可进行长期的投资布局。总结来看，在投资者进行自主
投资选择时，能源企业供需与高质量水平是决策风向标。

The Global Cooperation Barometer’s 5 pillars of global cooperation
Trade and capital
Promote global development and resilience
Focus of analysis is on i) development and resilient outcomes; through ii) presence of global economic flows that promote likely
opportunities for these outcomes
Innovation and technology
Accelerate innovation and beneficial technological progress
Focus of analysis is on i) global progress in innovation and technology; through ii) presence of the global sharing of underlying
knowledge that contributes to these outcomes by fostering collaboration across global talent
Climate and natural capital
Support the resolution of climate and natural capital challenges
Focus of analysis is on i) lowering of emissions, preservation of natural capital, and preparedness for likely impact of climate change;
through ii) shared global goals/commitments that increase humanity’s ability to limit and adapt to the dynamics of a changing climate
Health and wellness
Enable global population to lead longer and better lives
Focus of analysis is on i) impact of the burden of disease on duration and quality of life; through ii) commitment to global public
health standards and collaboration through flows of goods, R&D/IP and health financing
Peace and security
Prevent and resolve conflicts
Focus of analysis is on i) prevention of death and long-term negative implications of conflict; through ii) commitment to
multilateral peacekeeping operations and international stabilization efforts

1.2
随着数字技术的迅猛发展，所面临的安全挑战日益增多且变得复杂。个人信
息泄露、企业数据安全威胁、网络攻击以及数字诈骗的频发，均是数字化环境中
不容忽视的安全风险。数字化进程不仅代表着技术的创新，也意味着安全挑战的
不断升级。
国家的数字化战略、企业的数字化转型、个人的数字生活等，已深入渗透至
社会的各个方面。伴随而来的安全问题不再仅限于传统网络安全的范畴，而是拓
展至数据安全、智能设备安全及与数字身份相关的安全问题。数字化发展的快速
与广泛性，直接加剧了安全风险的严重性，使得数字安全成为亟待解决的重要问
题。
历史上，技术变革与社会变迁紧密相关。从 Schumpeter 的创新理论到创造
性破坏理论，均揭示了技术变革与社会经济、军事、文化和政治的深刻联系。每
次工业革命，从蒸汽机、内燃机、信息科技到当今的人工智能、清洁能源等，均
引领了社会变迁的潮流。然而，这些变革在创造新机遇的同时，也带来了金融泡
沫、经济衰退和社会危机等破坏性后果。
特别是在数字时代，自 2002 年以来，全球数据信息的存储方式从模拟转向
数字，信息传输与存储能力呈指数级增长。伴随着这一发展，数字技术带来的安
全挑战日益突出，例如CIH病毒、震网病毒等重大网络安全事件，以及斯诺登事
件暴露的全球监视网络问题，均反映了网络空间安全的重要性。

量子计算
2.1
量子计算的定义
2.1.1
传统计算机采用二进制的数字电子方式进行运算，仅能够表示0和1两种状
态。量子计算是一种遵循量子力学规律调控量子信息单元进行计算的新型计算模
式，它以量子比特为基本单元，利用量子叠加和量子纠缠的特性，能够同时表示
多个量子态的叠加。量子计算机的架构与传统计算机完全不同，它主要包含两个
部分，一个是量子芯片支持系统，用于提供量子芯片所必需的运行环境；另一个
是量子计算机控制系统，用于实现对量子芯片的控制，以完成运算过程并获得运
算结果。与此同时量子计算机在计算性能、适用性、信息携带量等方面有巨大突
破，可以作为 CPU的协处理器，对很多重大的数学难题进行指数级加速和破解常
见的公钥私钥密码系统。目前所说的量子计算机并非一个可独立完成计算任务的
设备，而是一个可以对特定问题有指数级别加速的协处理... (内容过长，已截断)',

2024 年国际原油价格分析与趋势预测
一、2023年国际原油价格走势回顾
（一）原油价格整体态势及演变历程
2023 年，俄乌局势陷入胶着、巴以战争骤然升级、局部冲突多点
频发，大国对抗和博弈对全球能源格局产生深远影响，供需多重因素
交织叠加，推动国际油价全年跌宕起伏。第一季度在经历一段较为稳
定的波动后，快速下跌至阶段性低点而后反弹；第二季度自阶段性高
点下滑至底部小幅震荡；第三季度持续上涨至年内最高点；第四季度
震荡下行至年初水平。Brent原油（Brent Crude Oil）期货年均价为82.17
美元/桶，WTI 原油（West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil）期货年均价
为 77.56 美元/桶，均同比下跌 17%左右。
图1 2023年国际油价走势图（数据来源：Wind）
具体分析如下：
1
上半年，国际原油价格基本呈现“高位稳定波动-快速涨跌-低位
稳定波动”态势。1-2 月，亚太地区经济复苏拉动原油需求增长、OPEC+
维持减产、欧美经济增长低于预期，利好利空因素相互博弈，基本面
支撑 Brent 油价在 77-89 美元/桶区间内高位窄幅震荡。3 月，美欧大
幅快速加息推高全球金融体系风险，硅谷银行破产等加剧市场担忧，
国际油价应声下跌近 15%。4 月初，沙特、伊拉克等 OPEC+多个成员
国宣布在减产 200 万桶/日基础上，将从 5 月开始进一步削减原油供
应量，总减产幅度超过 100 万桶/日，原油供应收紧，叠加银行业危机
缓解、欧美原油需求回升等因素，Brent油价快速冲高至87.3美元/桶，
随后由于缺乏基本面支撑一路下滑至 71.8 美元/桶，并在 5-6 月保持
低位窄幅波动。
下半年，沙特自愿再减产原油 100 万桶/日，日均产量减至 900 万
桶/日，并将此项措施延长到了 12 月底。俄罗斯宣布将 50 万桶/日减
产计划延长至 12 月，并自 8 月起暂停石油出口 50 万桶/日。重大飓
风“伊达利亚”对美国墨西哥湾原油生产及出口造成影响，三季度末
美国库欣原油库存降至 2200 万桶，接近最低运营水平，市场净多头
寸急速增加，油价一路高涨，并于 9 月 27 日创下年内最高点，Brent
原油期货价格达到 96.55 美元/桶，WTI 原油期货价格达到 93.68 美元
/桶。而后，巴以冲突爆发、红海危机等推动油价短期小幅上涨，但未
能改变供需基本面带来的压力，国际原油价格震荡下跌。
（二）Brent 与 WTI 原油价差变化趋势
2023 年 Brent 与 WTI 原油期货年度平均价差为 4.60 美元/桶。相
2
较 2022 年，价差全年波动较为平稳，在全球经济增长分化、美国原
油产量增加等因素影响下，呈现“扩大-收窄-扩大”态势，如图 2 所
示。
图2 Brent与WTI油价价差走势图（数据来源：Wind）
二、2024年国际原油市场形势分析
（一）原油市场基本面分析
1、全球经济温和复苏、能源低碳转型步伐加快，对原油需求形
成下行压力
全球经济增速持续放缓且不平衡。2023 年，世界各主要发达经济
体维持紧缩货币政策，加息不断，金融系统风险加大，经济增长动能
不足，全球制造业 PMI 指数从 2 月的 49.9%降至 10 月的 48.8%，经
济增速放缓。欧元区和英国经济增速下降幅度较大，分别从 2022 年
的 3.3%、4.1%下降至 0.7%、0.5%；美国保持 2.1%的增长，经济增速
与 2022 年持平。新兴经济体普遍好于欧美等发达经济体，中国经济
回升向好，扎实推进高质量发展，GDP 增速达 5%，在全球经济发展
3
中引擎作用显著；印度经济增速 6.3%，发展前景较为乐观。主要国家
GDP 增长率见图 3。
图3 主要经济体GDP年增长率（数据来源：IMF，世界银行）
能源转型步伐加快进一步降低化石能源份额。全球能源转型面临
挑战，但绿色低碳趋势不可逆转。世界各国陆续出台支持清洁能源发
展的政策，加大清洁能源投资力度，在能源转型中培育清洁能源的竞
争优势和领先地位。2023 年 12 月《联合国气候变化框架公约》第二
十八次缔约方大会（COP28）上，近 200 个缔约方形成共识，将“以
公正、有序、公平的方式减少能源系统对化石燃料的依赖”。控制化
石能源消费、大力发展可再生能源已经成为各国共识，化石能源消费
占比持续下降，如图 4 所示。
4
图4 2012-2022年世界能源消费占比图（数据来源：2023年世界能源统计年鉴）
2024 年，全球经济将面临利率高位运行、消费支出不足、贸易前
景悲观等挑战，增长动能不强，经济增速将进一步放缓，难以对原油
需求形成有力支撑；能源结构调整，化石能源消费占比持续下降还将
增大油价下行压力。
2、OPEC+减产效应有限，非 OPEC+产量不断增长，供应宽松
将抑制原油价格上涨
OPEC+减产效应预期不乐观。叠加延续和新增减产计划，截至
2023 年 11 月，OPEC+减产总规模为 266 万桶/日，成员国产量为 3622
万桶/日，低于产量配额，在一定程度上支撑了年度油价。但在政策实
施过程中也凸显出内部分歧、自愿减产缺乏约束力等问题。从第 36
届 OPEC+部长级会议声明来看，2024 年第一季度 OPEC+减产总规
模为 335 万桶/日，实际减产量比之前仅多约 50 万桶/日，自愿减产的
形式也将弱化执行效率。此外，为维持市场稳定和增强市场主导地位，
5
沙特等国家可能在 2024 年第二季度开启增产模式。
非 OPEC+国家产量持续增加。2023 年非 OPEC+原油产量达到
3820 万桶/日，增长 190 万桶/日，占全球原油供应比例接近 50%，如
图 5 所示。其中，美国原油产量迅猛增长，最高达到 1330 万桶/日，
为有史以来的最高水平。美国等非 OPEC+国家因已钻未完工井和活
跃钻机数量处于低位且呈下滑态势，长期增产能力不强。预计 2024
年，美国原油产量将延续增长趋势，但增速放缓。
图5 2013-2023年全球原油产量图（数据来源：IEA）
2024 年，预计 OPEC+减产政策调控空间有限，对油价的支撑作
用趋弱，非 OPEC+产量将持续增长，部分产油国地缘风险有所缓解，
全球原油供应整体处于较宽松状态，将抑制油价上涨。
3、原油库存释放转为回补，调节能力有所增强
美国原油库存规模下降。2023 年，美国政府释放战略石油储备抑
制油价上涨、降低通胀，战略石油储备量一度减少到 3.47 亿桶，为近
40 年的低位，全年原油总库存消费比远低于历史平均水平，如图 6 所
6
示。商业库存总体也低于近五年平均水平，如图 7 所示。预计 2024
年，美国将回补战略石油储备，增加原油库存以加强能源安全，缓解
市场对供应不确定性的担忧，原油库存上升将利于原油价格稳定。
图6 2023年美国原油库存消费比（数据来源：EIA）
图7 2023年美国商业原油库存（数据来源：EIA）
（二）原油市场非基本面分析
1、美元指数或将走弱，缓解原油价格下行压力
2023 年，美国累计加息 100 个基点，推动美元保持强劲态势，美
元指数全年基本维持在 100 点以上，如图 8 所示。随着紧缩财政政策
在控制通胀方面取得了实质性进展，美联储加息政策即将转向。美国
7
经济放缓迹象明显，预计 2024 年，美元指数震荡下行，利好原油价
格。
图8 美元指数与油价对比图（数据来源：EIA，Wind）
2、期货净多头比低于历史均值，市场看空氛围浓厚显著
2023 年，原油期货市场非商业净多头比波动明显，体现了市场投
资者情绪的剧烈波动，且全年净多头比基本低于近五年历史均值，市
场整体呈现悲观态势，如图 9 所示。2024 年，在全球经济增速放缓、
原油供应存在过剩等预期下，投资者仍将保持悲观情绪，看空市场将
抑制原油价格上涨。
图9 CFTC原油期货非商业净多头比（数据来源：Wind）
8
3、黄金价格增速降低，对原油价格拉动有限
2023 年，全球经济压力增大、多国央行购入黄金、市场避险情绪
明显等多重因素推动黄金价格持续走高，全年涨幅接近 15%，12 月
底达到 2078.40 美元/盎司的峰值，如图 10 所示。2024 年，美联储货
币政策转向将为黄金价格上涨提供支撑，国际金价预计还将继续冲高，
但增幅不及 2023 年，对原油价格增长贡献较少。
图10 国际黄金及原油价格走势图（数据来源：世界黄金协会、Wind）
4、中东冲突存在扩大风险，地缘政治加剧原油价格不确定性
2023 年，俄乌局势陷入胶着，巴以爆发新一轮大规模冲突并造成
红海危机等连锁反应，中东地区局势紧张，短期内推动油价上涨，如
图 11 所示。此外，俄乌局势改变全球原油贸易格局，俄罗斯主要出
口转向亚太地区，对基本面产生的潜在影响已逐渐消退。2024 年，巴
以冲突外溢效应或将扩大，原油国际运输主要航道易受影响，地缘冲
突也将增加中东地区原油供应的不确定性，油价存在短期上涨可能。

图11 2023年原油市场大事记图（数据来源：EIA，Wind）
三、2024年国际油价走势综合判断
2024 年，全球经济增速放缓，主要经济体分化加剧，美国经济增
速放缓，中国将继续成为拉动世界经济增长的重要引擎，能源低碳转
型提速，化石能源消费占比持续下降，原油需求承压；OPEC+减产政
策对油价影响逐步减弱，非 OPEC+原油产量保持增长，供应过剩预期
增强。总体来看，供需基本面难以对原油价格上涨形成有力支撑。
2024 年，美元指数走弱可能性大，黄金价格增长空间有限，原油
投资者信心不足，地缘冲突、极端天气等事件频发，多重因素叠加或
将在短期内放大原油价格震荡区间，市场风险增加。
运用北京理工大学能源与环境政策研究中心的原油价格预测与
风险管理平台（inems1.bit.edu.cn）对国际油价开展模拟分析，结合
预测模型客观计算和专家的主观判断，结果表明：2024 年国际原油价
格中枢将进一步下移，预计 Brent、WTI 原油均价在 73-83 美元/桶和
68-78 美元/桶范围。

2024 年国际原油价格分析与趋势预测
一、2023年国际原油价格走势回顾
（一）原油价格整体态势及演变历程
2023 年，俄乌局势陷入胶着、巴以战争骤然升级、局部冲突多点
频发，大国对抗和博弈对全球能源格局产生深远影响，供需多重因素
交织叠加，推动国际油价全年跌宕起伏。第一季度在经历一段较为稳
定的波动后，快速下跌至阶段性低点而后反弹；第二季度自阶段性高
点下滑至底部小幅震荡；第三季度持续上涨至年内最高点；第四季度
震荡下行至年初水平。Brent原油（Brent Crude Oil）期货年均价为82.17
美元/桶，WTI 原油（West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil）期货年均价
为 77.56 美元/桶，均同比下跌 17%左右。
图1 2023年国际油价走势图（数据来源：Wind）
具体分析如下：
1
上半年，国际原油价格基本呈现“高位稳定波动-快速涨跌-低位
稳定波动”态势。1-2 月，亚太地区经济复苏拉动原油需求增长、OPEC+
维持减产、欧美经济增长低于预期，利好利空因素相互博弈，基本面
支撑 Brent 油价在 77-89 美元/桶区间内高位窄幅震荡。3 月，美欧大
幅快速加息推高全球金融体系风险，硅谷银行破产等加剧市场担忧，
国际油价应声下跌近 15%。4 月初，沙特、伊拉克等 OPEC+多个成员
国宣布在减产 200 万桶/日基础上，将从 5 月开始进一步削减原油供
应量，总减产幅度超过 100 万桶/日，原油供应收紧，叠加银行业危机
缓解、欧美原油需求回升等因素，Brent油价快速冲高至87.3美元/桶，
随后由于缺乏基本面支撑一路下滑至 71.8 美元/桶，并在 5-6 月保持
低位窄幅波动。
下半年，沙特自愿再减产原油 100 万桶/日，日均产量减至 900 万
桶/日，并将此项措施延长到了 12 月底。俄罗斯宣布将 50 万桶/日减
产计划延长至 12 月，并自 8 月起暂停石油出口 50 万桶/日。重大飓
风“伊达利亚”对美国墨西哥湾原油生产及出口造成影响，三季度末
美国库欣原油库存降至 2200 万桶，接近最低运营水平，市场净多头
寸急速增加，油价一路高涨，并于 9 月 27 日创下年内最高点，Brent
原油期货价格达到 96.55 美元/桶，WTI 原油期货价格达到 93.68 美元
/桶。而后，巴以冲突爆发、红海危机等推动油价短期小幅上涨，但未
能改变供需基本面带来的压力，国际原油价格震荡下跌。
（二）Brent 与 WTI 原油价差变化趋势
2023 年 Brent 与 WTI 原油期货年度平均价差为 4.60 美元/桶。相
2
较 2022 年，价差全年波动较为平稳，在全球经济增长分化、美国原
油产量增加等因素影响下，呈现“扩大-收窄-扩大”态势，如图 2 所
示。
图2 Brent与WTI油价价差走势图（数据来源：Wind）
二、2024年国际原油市场形势分析
（一）原油市场基本面分析
1、全球经济温和复苏、能源低碳转型步伐加快，对原油需求形
成下行压力
全球经济增速持续放缓且不平衡。2023 年，世界各主要发达经济
体维持紧缩货币政策，加息不断，金融系统风险加大，经济增长动能
不足，全球制造业 PMI 指数从 2 月的 49.9%降至 10 月的 48.8%，经
济增速放缓。欧元区和英国经济增速下降幅度较大，分别从 2022 年
的 3.3%、4.1%下降至 0.7%、0.5%；美国保持 2.1%的增长，经济增速
与 2022 年持平。新兴经济体普遍好于欧美等发达经济体，中国经济
回升向好，扎实推进高质量发展，GDP 增速达 5%，在全球经济发展
3
中引擎作用显著；印度经济增速 6.3%，发展前景较为乐观。主要国家
GDP 增长率见图 3。
图3 主要经济体GDP年增长率（数据来源：IMF，世界银行）
能源转型步伐加快进一步降低化石能源份额。全球能源转型面临
挑战，但绿色低碳趋势不可逆转。世界各国陆续出台支持清洁能源发
展的政策，加大清洁能源投资力度，在能源转型中培育清洁能源的竞
争优势和领先地位。2023 年 12 月《联合国气候变化框架公约》第二
十八次缔约方大会（COP28）上，近 200 个缔约方形成共识，将“以
公正、有序、公平的方式减少能源系统对化石燃料的依赖”。控制化
石能源消费、大力发展可再生能源已经成为各国共识，化石能源消费
占比持续下降，如图 4 所示。
4
图4 2012-2022年世界能源消费占比图（数据来源：2023年世界能源统计年鉴）
2024 年，全球经济将面临利率高位运行、消费支出不足、贸易前
景悲观等挑战，增长动能不强，经济增速将进一步放缓，难以对原油
需求形成有力支撑；能源结构调整，化石能源消费占比持续下降还将
增大油价下行压力。
2、OPEC+减产效应有限，非 OPEC+产量不断增长，供应宽松
将抑制原油价格上涨
OPEC+减产效应预期不乐观。叠加延续和新增减产计划，截至
2023 年 11 月，OPEC+减产总规模为 266 万桶/日，成员国产量为 3622
万桶/日，低于产量配额，在一定程度上支撑了年度油价。但在政策实
施过程中也凸显出内部分歧、自愿减产缺乏约束力等问题。从第 36
届 OPEC+部长级会议声明来看，2024 年第一季度 OPEC+减产总规
模为 335 万桶/日，实际减产量比之前仅多约 50 万桶/日，自愿减产的
形式也将弱化执行效率。此外，为维持市场稳定和增强市场主导地位，
5
沙特等国家可能在 2024 年第二季度开启增产模式。
非 OPEC+国家产量持续增加。2023 年非 OPEC+原油产量达到
3820 万桶/日，增长 190 万桶/日，占全球原油供应比例接近 50%，如
图 5 所示。其中，美国原油产量迅猛增长，最高达到 1330 万桶/日，
为有史以来的最高水平。美国等非 OPEC+国家因已钻未完工井和活
跃钻机数量处于低位且呈下滑态势，长期增产能力不强。预计 2024
年，美国原油产量将延续增长趋势，但增速放缓。
图5 2013-2023年全球原油产量图（数据来源：IEA）
2024 年，预计 OPEC+减产政策调控空间有限，对油价的支撑作
用趋弱，非 OPEC+产量将持续增长，部分产油国地缘风险有所缓解，
全球原油供应整体处于较宽松状态，将抑制油价上涨。
3、原油库存释放转为回补，调节能力有所增强
美国原油库存规模下降。2023 年，美国政府释放战略石油储备抑
制油价上涨、降低通胀，战略石油储备量一度减少到 3.47 亿桶，为近
40 年的低位，全年原油总库存消费比远低于历史平均水平，如图 6 所
6
示。商业库存总体也低于近五年平均水平，如图 7 所示。预计 2024
年，美国将回补战略石油储备，增加原油库存以加强能源安全，缓解
市场对供应不确定性的担忧，原油库存上升将利于原油价格稳定。
图6 2023年美国原油库存消费比（数据来源：EIA）
图7 2023年美国商业原油库存（数据来源：EIA）
（二）原油市场非基本面分析
1、美元指数或将走弱，缓解原油价格下行压力
2023 年，美国累计加息 100 个基点，推动美元保持强劲态势，美
元指数全年基本维持在 100 点以上，如图 8 所示。随着紧缩财政政策
在控制通胀方面取得了实质性进展，美联储加息政策即将转向。美国
7
经济放缓迹象明显，预计 2024 年，美元指数震荡下行，利好原油价
格。
图8 美元指数与油价对比图（数据来源：EIA，Wind）
2、期货净多头比低于历史均值，市场看空氛围浓厚显著
2023 年，原油期货市场非商业净多头比波动明显，体现了市场投
资者情绪的剧烈波动，且全年净多头比基本低于近五年历史均值，市
场整体呈现悲观态势，如图 9 所示。2024 年，在全球经济增速放缓、
原油供应存在过剩等预期下，投资者仍将保持悲观情绪，看空市场将
抑制原油价格上涨。
图9 CFTC原油期货非商业净多头比（数据来源：Wind）
8
3、黄金价格增速降低，对原油价格拉动有限
2023 年，全球经济压力增大、多国央行购入黄金、市场避险情绪
明显等多重因素推动黄金价格持续走高，全年涨幅接近 15%，12 月
底达到 2078.40 美元/盎司的峰值，如图 10 所示。2024 年，美联储货
币政策转向将为黄金价格上涨提供支撑，国际金价预计还将继续冲高，
但增幅不及 2023 年，对原油价格增长贡献较少。
图10 国际黄金及原油价格走势图（数据来源：世界黄金协会、Wind）
4、中东冲突存在扩大风险，地缘政治加剧原油价格不确定性
2023 年，俄乌局势陷入胶着，巴以爆发新一轮大规模冲突并造成
红海危机等连锁反应，中东地区局势紧张，短期内推动油价上涨，如
图 11 所示。此外，俄乌局势改变全球原油贸易格局，俄罗斯主要出
口转向亚太地区，对基本面产生的潜在影响已逐渐消退。2024 年，巴
以冲突外溢效应或将扩大，原油国际运输主要航道易受影响，地缘冲
突也将增加中东地区原油供应的不确定性，油价存在短期上涨可能。
9
图11 2023年原油市场大事记图（数据来源：EIA，Wind）
三、2024年国际油价走势综合判断
2024 年，全球经济增速放缓，主要经济体分化加剧，美国经济增
速放缓，中国将继续成为拉动世界经济增长的重要引擎，能源低碳转
型提速，化石能源消费占比持续下降，原油需求承压；OPEC+减产政
策对油价影响逐步减弱，非 OPEC+原油产量保持增长，供应过剩预期
增强。总体来看，供需基本面难以对原油价格上涨形成有力支撑。
2024 年，美元指数走弱可能性大，黄金价格增长空间有限，原油
投资者信心不足，地缘冲突、极端天气等事件频发，多重因素叠加或
将在短期内放大原油价格震荡区间，市场风险增加。
运用北京理工大学能源与环境政策研究中心的原油价格预测与
风险管理平台（inems1.bit.edu.cn）对国际油价开展模拟分析，结合
预测模型客观计算和专家的主观判断，结果表明：2024 年国际原油价
格中枢将进一步下移，预计 Brent、WTI 原油均价在 73-83 美元/桶和
68-78 美元/桶范围。

2024 年国际天然气市场分析与趋势预测
一、2023 年国际天然气市场价格走势回顾
2023 年，全球经济复苏缓慢、中国新冠疫情政策放开、俄乌冲
突引发的天然气危机缓和，多重因素影响天然气价格走势，上半年
JKM 和 TTF 震荡下落，下半年 JKM 和 TTF 波动回升。HH 价格维持
低位稳定。由于欧亚两大需求地区在 LNG 市场上的竞争，JKM 和 TTF
价格关联性强、走势基本相同。2023 年三大国际天然气价格走势如
图 1 所示。
图 1 三大国际天然气市场价格(数据来源：S&P Global Commodity Insights)
具体分析如下：
1-6 月，去年冬季相对暖和、欧盟成员国自愿削减天然气需求增
强储气、地缘冲突短暂冷却，TTF 小幅震荡下落，第一季度均价为
16.69 美元/百万英热单位，第二季度均价为 11.20 美元/百万英热单位。
1
JKM 价格从 20 美元/百万英热单位左右呈下降趋势，5 月进一步下降
到 9 美元/百万英热单位左右。HH 价格第一季度呈下降趋势，降幅相
对较大。1 月 48 个州大部分地区气温温和，与过去十年相比 HDD（取
暖指数）减少 16%，需求缩小，同时干天然气产量比五年平均水平高
11%。第二季度，价格相对平稳，4、5 月份维持低位在 2.5 美元/百万
英热单位以下。6 月波动上升，低气价削弱上游开采活动，钻机数量
减少，且天然气库存增幅低于预期，带动价格低位反弹。
7-9 月，挪威管道检修扰动供应端，TTF 预备低位震荡回升，第
三季度均价为 10.56 美元/百万英热单位。JKM 价格 7 月在高库存和
低需求的背景下稳定在 11 美元/百万英热单位。8 月，澳大利亚主要
天然气项目罢工的不确定性导致价格小幅上涨，在 9 月实施罢工后
JKM 价格升至 15 美元/百万英热单位。HH 价格保持在 2.5 美元/百万
英热单位上下。
10-12 月，澳大利亚工人罢工危机、巴以冲突加剧、红海格局严
峻、采暖季供热需要，TTF 持续缓慢波动上行，第四季度均价为 13.57
美元/百万英热单位。JKM价格10月受中东冲突爆发等因素影响，JKM
价格升至 17 美元/百万英热单位。11 月地缘政治风险有所缓解，价格
稳定在 14 美元/百万英热单位。12 月价格季节性波动至 15 美元/百万
英热单位左右。HH价格10-11月呈 M形态，北美地区存在降温预期，
取暖用气需求增加，LNG 出口有所减弱。

二、世界天然气供需格局判断
（一）北美
1. 美国发电用气扩大，LNG 出口持续增长
天然气在美国能源格局中发挥核心作用，天然气需求在 2023 年
第一季度到第三季度同比增长 0.8%（50 亿立方米）。由于天气温和，
居民和商业天然气消费在前三季度同比收缩超 6%（100 亿立方米）。
节能改造、用能效率提升和热泵推广推动居民和商业部门天然气消费
减少，预计 2024 年居民和商业天然气需求下降。
2023 年美国前三季度实际 GDP 分别增长 2.2%、2.1%和 5.2%，
经济复苏表现超预期，但前三季度制造业采购经理指数（PMI）平均
值为 47，通胀压力在短期内难以消除，高通胀持续打压需求、银行
业危机冲击信贷市场，致制造业萎缩依然持续，前三季度工业用气需
求同比下降 1%（20 亿立方米）。
天然气需求增长完全由电力部门推动，天然气发电需求增长了
6%（160 亿立方米）。水电和煤电在前三季度同比下降了近 20%，天
然气发电占比从 2021 年 1 月的 34%上升到 2023 年 8 月的 45%以上，
创下有记录以来的最高月度平均水平。2023 年共有 16 家天然气发电
厂投产，新增总发电能力达到 8.6GW。天然气价格大幅下跌，燃煤
电厂退役，风电和水电发电量低，部分地区制冷需求高等因素综合作
用，导致天然气占比增加。预计 2024 年可再生能源的持续扩张，电
力部门消费有所减少，居民和商业需求逐渐减少，天然气总体需求量
会有所下降。

美国天然气出口持续走高，成为全球最大的液化天然气出口国。
Calcasieu Pass 继续扩产和自由港 LNG 出口终端恢复运营，LNG 产量
提高。全球 LNG 需求保持强劲且持续增长，特别是欧洲。随芬兰、
德国、意大利和西班牙再气化新终端上线，欧洲再气化能力持续扩大，
LNG 需求增多，加大对美国 LNG 进口以弥补俄罗斯管道进口的减少
和补充库存。随 LNG 出口项目的建成，预计 2024 年 LNG 出口进一
步扩大。
4
图 3 美国天然气出口量(数据来源：EIA)
2. 美国气田产量创新高，库存水平略涨
美国天然气产量创新高，根据 EIA 数据美国 2023 年的日均产量
为 103.36Bcf,同比增长 4.15%。自 2023 年初以来，美国天然气价格开
始下跌，企业为降低开发成本，减少钻井活动，倾向于向投资者返还
资金和偿清债务，开支更多地用于支付因通胀带来的高额劳动力成本，
而非提高油气产量。因此，活跃钻井数大幅下降，2023 年前四个月，
天然气钻机数在 150~162 个之间波动，5 月份开始下降，9 月 8 日降
至最低点 113 个钻机，截至 2023 年 12 月 8 日为 119 个，同比 2022
年下降了 23.23%。
天然气产量的大幅增长主要因为由石油驱动的页岩开采区的伴
生气产量的增加。二叠纪（Permian）盆地是伴生气的最大来源，其
产，量在 2023 年 1 月至 7 月期间同比增长了 10%，达 4.8 亿立方米/
天，为历史最高水平。2023 年前八个月，仅二叠纪盆地的天然气产
量就占美国天然气增量的 30%。轻质致密油的持续开发和天然气与石
5
油比率的提高促进天然气产量的增加。增加输送能力是消除二叠纪盆
地瓶颈的关键。到 2023 年底，墨西哥湾海岸快线、二叠纪高速公路
和惠斯勒管道的扩建将增加 170 亿立方米/年的输送能力。Matterhorn
Express 管道项目（260 亿立方米/年）预计将于 2024 年投入使用。得
益于山谷(Mountain Valley)管道项目（210 亿立方米/年）的启动，阿
巴拉契亚(Appalachian)盆地的天然气输出量预计将在 2022 年至 2026
年间增加 6%（200 亿立方米），该项目预计于 2024 年投入运营。其
他页岩气产量预计在 2022-2026 年间将增加近 15%（500 亿立方米）。
图 4 美国区域页岩气产量(数据来源：EIA）
美国 2023 年注气季开始时，储气库的注气量达到 43%，比五年
平均水平高出近 20%（80 亿立方米）。美国国内天然气产量的强劲增
长支撑了第二季度高于五年平均水平7%的净注入量，净注入量为290
亿立方米。第三季度产量增长放缓，加上天然气发电需求高涨和液化
天然气出口增加，抑制了储气库注气量，为 160 亿立方米，比五年平
均水平低 25%。虽然注气放缓缓解了美国的储气过剩，但 9 月底的库
存水平仍比五年平均水平高出 5%，达到 81%的填充水平。相比之下，
6
常规天然气产量在预测期内将继续下降。预计到 2026 年，页岩气产
量将占美国天然气总产量的近 80%。
美国天然气产量增加主要由向全球天然气市场的 LNG 出口量增
加以及向墨西哥的管道天然气输送量增加驱动。天然气国内需求微弱
下降，出口强劲增长推动天然气生产，预计 2024 年产量增加。
（二）欧盟
1. 天然气市场供应紧张，LNG 成最大变量
欧盟 27 国本土天然气产量持续萎靡，荷兰格罗宁根气田关闭。
根据 Eurostat 数据，2023 年前九个月本土天然气产量 295 亿立方米，
相较 2021 年下降 23.37%，主要是因为欧洲最大天然气气田——荷兰
格罗宁根气田的关闭。根据路透社信息，格罗宁根气田 2023 年仅产
气 105 亿立方米，到 2024 年降为零，其他气田产气量同比下降 34.34%。
2024 年，预计欧盟天然气产量下行压力增大。
图 5 欧盟本土产量(数据来源：Eurostat)
俄乌冲突和挪威管道检修高位，管道气进口严重受限。根据
7
Eurostat 数据，2023 年前九个月欧盟总进口 3575 亿立方米，同比下
降 22.50%。Entsog 数据统计，2023 年前 50 周，LNG 进口占总量的
41.74%，为欧盟提供1274亿立方米的天然气。挪威占比第二为28.28%，
相比 2022 年下降 4.45%，主要是由于挪威管道夏季大量检修。受俄
乌冲突影响，由俄罗斯进口的天然气占比从 2021 年的 41.34%骤降至
9.18%，主要是因为俄罗斯管道气总供应量大幅下降——Tukstream 小
幅波动，Nord Stream和Yamal停气断供，Ukraine供应同比下降31.67%。
管道气被制约，LNG 成欧盟天然气最大变量，再气化产能利用
率成供给瓶颈信号灯。根据 GIE-ALSI 数据，2019-2021 年拥有 LNG
接收站的欧盟国家平均再气化产能利用率是 50.20%，2023 年上升至
66.31%。2023 年 9 月 19 日，欧盟与卡塔尔达成两项规模最大、期限
最长的 LNG 供应协议，与俄罗斯天然气“硬脱钩”。
图 6 欧盟进口来源情况(数据来源：Entsog)
地缘政治局势变化，进口 LNG 备受影响。红海航运危机持续，
中东 LNG 到欧洲的船运时间延长，成本增加。根据卓创资讯数据，
8
2023 年中东 LNG 流向欧洲的占比降至 13%，对应美国 LNG 去往欧
洲的占比增长至 41%。另外，巴以冲突升级将导致塔尔玛气田暂停生
产，使得以色列向埃及的出口大幅减少，进而间接影响埃及向欧洲出
口天然气。
2. 暖冬及经济复苏缓慢，天然气需求弱势
为应对地缘政治威胁、增强能源供应安全，欧盟确立自愿消减
15%天然气需求目标（相比过去五年的平均天然气消费量）。据
Eurostat 数据统计，截止 2023 年 9 月，欧盟共出口 1406 亿立方米天
然气（包括欧盟内部流通），比 2022 年前九个月下降 28.71%。欧盟
内陆消费量达 2345.62 亿立方米，同比下降 9.99%，相较 2021 年前九
个月的 2909.05 亿立方米减少 19.37%。
暖冬压制家庭取暖需求预期，天然气消费总体呈“U 型”季节性走
势。根据 Eurostat，2019-2022 年采暖季（每年 11 月到次年 3 月）平
均天然气消费量占当年总量的 56.03%，并逐年微弱抬升。
图 7 欧盟内陆消费(数据来源:Eurostat)
全球经济复苏缓慢且不均衡，因工厂关停或转向其他燃料，欧洲
9
工业需求受压制，预计 2024 年工业用气增速缓慢。根据 IMF 数据，
2022 年的全球经济增长率为 3.5%，预计 2024 年低至 2.9%。
电力方面，欧盟整体用电量减少，用气发电需求疲软，叠加可再
生能源发电持续建设。欧洲电力生产涉及多种能源，包括煤、石油、
天然气、可再生能源和生物质能等。根据 Eurostat 数据，截止 2023
年 8 月，净发电总量达 1704417.39 GWh，同比下降 4.42%，其中，
可再生能源发电占比高达 30.64%。天然气发电占比 17.34%，发电量
为 295540.453 GWh，较 2022 年下降 14.30%，主要由于水力、风力
和太阳能发电量平均同比上涨 11.44%，一定程度上替代气电需求。
3. 天然气保持库存高位，周环比下降
利用乌克兰库容增强储气，提供额外冬季保障。2023 年夏季开
始，欧盟向乌克兰反向输气，采暖季再从乌克兰气库提取天然气。根
据 GIE 数据，截止 2023 年 12 月初，欧盟天然气存储率达 88.69%，
同比上升 4.84%，高于前年 30.36%。AGSI 数据显示，2023 年 12 月，
欧盟天然气储气量达 989.97 亿立方米，比 2022 年同期增长 6.78%，
周环比下降 2.6%。欧盟接近满库入冬，无极端寒冷天气前提下将不
会发生气源短缺危机。
10
图 8 欧盟天然气储量(数据来源:AGSI)
注：最大值和最小值时间范围是 2015-2020
综上，红海危机持续、荷兰格罗宁根气田关闭、俄乌冲突长期持
续等多重因素交织影响下，2024 年，欧盟天然气供给端上行压力增
大，进口重心转移至美国和卡塔尔，与亚洲 LNG 市场竞争加大。值
得注意的是，供应端愈发依赖 LNG 意味着 TTF 价格波动易受外界扰
动影响。2024 年，欧盟成员国自愿削弱天然气需求目标延长，存气
省气节能，大力普及发展可再生能源，天然气需求受限。
（三）亚洲
1. 供给
1.1 日韩LNG进口小幅减少，中国LNG进口仍处在恢复阶段
2023年1-11月，日本共进口液化天然气59.39MT（百万吨），同比
下降9.93%；2023年1-10月，韩国共进口液化天然气35.71MT，同比减
少6.96%，主要由于相对温和的天气、工业需求疲软和核能供应增加。
2023年1-11月，中国共进口液化天然气63.06 MT，同比上升7.91%，
11
主要由于服务业的恢复、水电下降和夏季高温导致的发电用气量增长，
但尚未恢复到2021年同时期87.12MT的水平。

1.2 巴拿马运河拥堵限制美亚LNG贸易
2023年7月以来，巴拿马运河受罕见干旱影响，水位处以低位，
导致运河拥堵，船舶通行量下降，等待时间上升。根据巴拿马运河管
理机构公告，自2023年第四季度起，运河将进一步限制船舶通行数量
至18艘，仅为运河正常通行数量的一半。巴拿马运河是美国与东北亚
LNG贸易的重要通道，运河拥堵将降低运输效率，提升运输成本，限
制东北亚进口LNG供应。预计2024年，美亚LNG贸易将继续受限。
1.3 日韩天然气库存保持高位
经历了2022年的天然气短缺危机后，2023年日韩天然气库存处于
高位。截止2023年12月，日本发电用LNG库存量265万吨，高于2022
年与过去五年平均库存水平。截止2023年第三季度，韩国天然气天然
12
气库存量492.1万吨，同比增长23.8%。预计2024年，日韩天然气库存
仍将保持高位。

图11 韩国天然气库存情况（数据来源：KESIS）
2. 需求
2.1 日韩天然气消费萎靡，中国天然气恢复式增长
截止2023年7月，日本电力部门消费LNG20.79万吨，同比下降
23.8%，主要由于2023年核能发电的使用。城燃消费LNG17.29万吨，
同比下降10.78%。2023年前三季度，韩国天然气消费量3196万吨，同
13
比下降3.29%，主要来自城燃消费、制造业用气的减少。2023年，中
国天然气消费量约为3750亿立方米，主要增量来自于交通和公共服务
用气。
2.2 经济增长
内需旺盛，日本经济或将迎来温和复苏。2023年，日本经济表现
亮眼，前三季度实际GDP增速1.7%，主要得益于出口和强劲的消费。
据日本内阁数据，由于进口强势的预期，将2024年实际GDP增速从1.3%
上调至1.6%。预计2024年日本经济迎来温和复苏。
通胀走高，韩国经济发展面临压力。2023年，韩国高利率和高通
胀共存。自2022年以来，韩国央行已提高基准利率8次，但尚未缓解
通胀压力。2023年11月，韩国居民生活用电和燃气价格分别同比上涨
14%和5.6%。根据韩国央行预测，主要由于疲软的国内外需求和紧缩
性的货币政策，2024年经济增速从2.2%下调至2.1%。
2.3 核能发电发展
日韩非化石能源进一步发展。据日本能源经济部披露，2023年日
本重启三台核能发电设备平均运行9个月发电量为82.8TWh。据日本
能源经济部预计，2024年日本将重启三台核能发电设备，并将总运行
设备数量维持在16台。据韩国能源经济研究院披露，过去五年，韩国
核能发电年均增长率3.5%，可再生能源发电年均增长率9.6%。预计
2024年，日韩核能发电比例将继续提高。
2.4 天气因素
23年暖冬形式或将不再持续。据日本气象组织披露，2023年冬季
14
日本平均温度同比降低0.6摄氏度。同时，该组织预测，2024年夏季
和冬季平均温度将同比降低2.1摄氏度和0.3摄氏度。韩国能源经济研
究院披露，2023年韩国HDD为2372.9，低于2022年2567.1水平，并预
测2024年HDD为2433.9。预计2024年，日韩HDD水平将上升。
（四）中国
1. 经济恢复支撑天然气市场持续复苏
据上海石油天然气交易中心发布报告显示，2023 年 1-9 月我国天
然气消费量约 2709 亿立方米，2023 年全年天然气消费量约 3750 亿
立方米，同比增加 199 亿立方米，增幅 5.6%。天然气占一次能源消
费总量将达到 9.0%，增加 0.6 个百分点。由于 2022 年经济形势低迷，
天然气消费量受宏观经济影响首次下降，2023 年天然气市场增量以
恢复性增长为主，预计在 2022-2026 年期间，需求增长将保持强劲，
平均每年 8%。从消费结构来看，2023 年我国天然气消费以城市燃气
和工业燃料为主，占比之和约为 75%。2023 年城市燃气用气占比约
38.8%，增量达到 132 亿立方米。城市燃气增量主要来自交通（LNG
重卡销售火爆）和公共服务用气。公共服务用气同比增加 35 亿立方
米；交通用气同比大幅增加50亿立方米。工业燃料用气占比约36.4%，
同比下降1.6个百分点，工业用气增长不及预期，这主要受需求疲软、
出口放缓、库存堆积、气价偏高、煤炭政策宽松等因素影响，工业增
长乏力，2021 年全国规模以上工业增加值同比增长 9.6% ，2022 年
规模以上工业增加值增长 3.6%，2023 年全年工业增加值同比增长超
4.3%，不及预期。2023 年发电用气占总用气量的 16.9%，截至 2023
15
年底，我国天然气发电总装机容量 12219 万千瓦，占全国总装机的
4.4%，远低于四分之一左右的全球平均水平，预计到 2025 年，我国
天然气发电装机容量将会突破1.5亿千瓦，占总装机容量的6%左右。
2024 年,中国天然气发电需求量将持续上升。化工用气将占总用气量
的 8.0%。中国天然气市场发展总体平稳。2024 年中国经济有望在提
质增量中稳步前行，初步预计2024年全国天然气消费量3850亿~3900
亿立方米，增长主要受城市燃气和发电用气驱动。但预计随着上游成
本压力趋缓和中下游需求得到有效提振，工业经济有望持续恢复，从
而带动工业天然气需求增长。

2. 立足国内扩大生产，提升自主能力
2023 年以来，我国天然气产量快速增长。根据国家统计局数据
显示，2023 年 1-11 月份，天然气累计产量 2095.9 亿立方米，2022 年
1-11 月份为 1974.0 亿立方米，同比上涨 6.18%。2022 年 12 月 27 日
长庆油田成为了我国首个年产 500 亿立方米特大气区，每年增产天然
气超 20 亿立方米，累产超 6000 亿立方米。2023 年 12 月 14 日，西
16
南地区建成年产 400 亿立方米大气区，2023 年我国海洋油气产量有
望再创新高，新增产量19亿立方米,约占全国天然气产量增量的15%。
以能源饭碗牢牢地端在自己手里为目标，坚持加大油气资源勘探开发
和增储上产力度，体现了把能源保供稳价放在首位，提高安全保障水
平的基本原则。预计 2024 年中国天然气产量约为 2400 亿立方米。
图 13 中国天然气生产量(数据来源:国家统计局)
3. 天然气进口稳步增长
根据中商产业研究院研究报告，1-11 月我国天然气累计进口量
10739.7 万吨，同比增长 8.5%。2023 年 1—9 月天然气总进口量达 1208
亿立方米，同比增加 116 亿立方米，增幅 10.6%。其中：进口管道气
501 亿立方米，同比增加 23 亿立方米，增幅 4.8%，受俄乌冲突影响，
俄罗斯出口中国管道天然气逐年上涨，根据海关数据显示，2023 年 1
月-11 月，中国进口俄罗斯管道气价值总额合计 412 亿元，约为 2022
年全年的 1.5 倍。2022 年受世界 LNG 市场价格暴增影响，液化天然
气进口量大幅下降，2023 虽有所上升但进口 LNG 量仍不及 2021 年
水平，截至 2023 年 12 月 24 日，上海石油天然气交易中心中国 LNG
17
综合进口到岸价格指数为 178.46，同比下降 18.24%，中国作为进口
国，2023 年 1 月-11 月进口 LNG 货值约 2743 亿元，2022 年 1 月-11
月约为 3072 亿元，这主要得益于 2023 年整体气价趋于平稳。进口
LNG以长协为主导。2023年前三季度，我国LNG进口长协量为4099.8
万吨，同比增加 53%，占进口总量的 73.76%。2024 年长协净新增约
530 万吨。较 2023 年略有减少，预计 2024 年中国进口 LNG 量将会
达到 7900 万吨。

4. 基础设施建设持续推进
10 年间，中国与有关国家和地区先后共同建成投产了中国—中
亚天然气管道 ABC 线、中缅原油和天然气管道、中俄东线天然气管
道等跨境油... (内容过长，已截断)',

2024 年国际天然气市场分析与趋势预测
一、2023 年国际天然气市场价格走势回顾
2023 年，全球经济复苏缓慢、中国新冠疫情政策放开、俄乌冲
突引发的天然气危机缓和，多重因素影响天然气价格走势，上半年
JKM 和 TTF 震荡下落，下半年 JKM 和 TTF 波动回升。HH 价格维持
低位稳定。由于欧亚两大需求地区在 LNG 市场上的竞争，JKM 和 TTF
价格关联性强、走势基本相同。2023 年三大国际天然气价格走势如
图 1 所示。
图 1 三大国际天然气市场价格(数据来源：S&P Global Commodity Insights)
具体分析如下：
1-6 月，去年冬季相对暖和、欧盟成员国自愿削减天然气需求增
强储气、地缘冲突短暂冷却，TTF 小幅震荡下落，第一季度均价为
16.69 美元/百万英热单位，第二季度均价为 11.20 美元/百万英热单位。
1
JKM 价格从 20 美元/百万英热单位左右呈下降趋势，5 月进一步下降
到 9 美元/百万英热单位左右。HH 价格第一季度呈下降趋势，降幅相
对较大。1 月 48 个州大部分地区气温温和，与过去十年相比 HDD（取
暖指数）减少 16%，需求缩小，同时干天然气产量比五年平均水平高
11%。第二季度，价格相对平稳，4、5 月份维持低位在 2.5 美元/百万
英热单位以下。6 月波动上升，低气价削弱上游开采活动，钻机数量
减少，且天然气库存增幅低于预期，带动价格低位反弹。
7-9 月，挪威管道检修扰动供应端，TTF 预备低位震荡回升，第
三季度均价为 10.56 美元/百万英热单位。JKM 价格 7 月在高库存和
低需求的背景下稳定在 11 美元/百万英热单位。8 月，澳大利亚主要
天然气项目罢工的不确定性导致价格小幅上涨，在 9 月实施罢工后
JKM 价格升至 15 美元/百万英热单位。HH 价格保持在 2.5 美元/百万
英热单位上下。
10-12 月，澳大利亚工人罢工危机、巴以冲突加剧、红海格局严
峻、采暖季供热需要，TTF 持续缓慢波动上行，第四季度均价为 13.57
美元/百万英热单位。JKM价格10月受中东冲突爆发等因素影响，JKM
价格升至 17 美元/百万英热单位。11 月地缘政治风险有所缓解，价格
稳定在 14 美元/百万英热单位。12 月价格季节性波动至 15 美元/百万
英热单位左右。HH价格10-11月呈 M形态，北美地区存在降温预期，
取暖用气需求增加，LNG 出口有所减弱。

二、世界天然气供需格局判断
（一）北美
1. 美国发电用气扩大，LNG 出口持续增长
天然气在美国能源格局中发挥核心作用，天然气需求在 2023 年
第一季度到第三季度同比增长 0.8%（50 亿立方米）。由于天气温和，
居民和商业天然气消费在前三季度同比收缩超 6%（100 亿立方米）。
节能改造、用能效率提升和热泵推广推动居民和商业部门天然气消费
减少，预计 2024 年居民和商业天然气需求下降。
2023 年美国前三季度实际 GDP 分别增长 2.2%、2.1%和 5.2%，
经济复苏表现超预期，但前三季度制造业采购经理指数（PMI）平均
值为 47，通胀压力在短期内难以消除，高通胀持续打压需求、银行
业危机冲击信贷市场，致制造业萎缩依然持续，前三季度工业用气需
求同比下降 1%（20 亿立方米）。
天然气需求增长完全由电力部门推动，天然气发电需求增长了
6%（160 亿立方米）。水电和煤电在前三季度同比下降了近 20%，天
然气发电占比从 2021 年 1 月的 34%上升到 2023 年 8 月的 45%以上，
创下有记录以来的最高月度平均水平。2023 年共有 16 家天然气发电
厂投产，新增总发电能力达到 8.6GW。天然气价格大幅下跌，燃煤
电厂退役，风电和水电发电量低，部分地区制冷需求高等因素综合作
用，导致天然气占比增加。预计 2024 年可再生能源的持续扩张，电
力部门消费有所减少，居民和商业需求逐渐减少，天然气总体需求量
会有所下降。

美国天然气出口持续走高，成为全球最大的液化天然气出口国。
Calcasieu Pass 继续扩产和自由港 LNG 出口终端恢复运营，LNG 产量
提高。全球 LNG 需求保持强劲且持续增长，特别是欧洲。随芬兰、
德国、意大利和西班牙再气化新终端上线，欧洲再气化能力持续扩大，
LNG 需求增多，加大对美国 LNG 进口以弥补俄罗斯管道进口的减少
和补充库存。随 LNG 出口项目的建成，预计 2024 年 LNG 出口进一
步扩大。

2. 美国气田产量创新高，库存水平略涨
美国天然气产量创新高，根据 EIA 数据美国 2023 年的日均产量
为 103.36Bcf,同比增长 4.15%。自 2023 年初以来，美国天然气价格开
始下跌，企业为降低开发成本，减少钻井活动，倾向于向投资者返还
资金和偿清债务，开支更多地用于支付因通胀带来的高额劳动力成本，
而非提高油气产量。因此，活跃钻井数大幅下降，2023 年前四个月，
天然气钻机数在 150~162 个之间波动，5 月份开始下降，9 月 8 日降
至最低点 113 个钻机，截至 2023 年 12 月 8 日为 119 个，同比 2022
年下降了 23.23%。
天然气产量的大幅增长主要因为由石油驱动的页岩开采区的伴
生气产量的增加。二叠纪（Permian）盆地是伴生气的最大来源，其
产，量在 2023 年 1 月至 7 月期间同比增长了 10%，达 4.8 亿立方米/
天，为历史最高水平。2023 年前八个月，仅二叠纪盆地的天然气产
量就占美国天然气增量的 30%。轻质致密油的持续开发和天然气与石
5
油比率的提高促进天然气产量的增加。增加输送能力是消除二叠纪盆
地瓶颈的关键。到 2023 年底，墨西哥湾海岸快线、二叠纪高速公路
和惠斯勒管道的扩建将增加 170 亿立方米/年的输送能力。Matterhorn
Express 管道项目（260 亿立方米/年）预计将于 2024 年投入使用。得
益于山谷(Mountain Valley)管道项目（210 亿立方米/年）的启动，阿
巴拉契亚(Appalachian)盆地的天然气输出量预计将在 2022 年至 2026
年间增加 6%（200 亿立方米），该项目预计于 2024 年投入运营。其
他页岩气产量预计在 2022-2026 年间将增加近 15%（500 亿立方米）。
图 4 美国区域页岩气产量(数据来源：EIA）
美国 2023 年注气季开始时，储气库的注气量达到 43%，比五年
平均水平高出近 20%（80 亿立方米）。美国国内天然气产量的强劲增
长支撑了第二季度高于五年平均水平7%的净注入量，净注入量为290
亿立方米。第三季度产量增长放缓，加上天然气发电需求高涨和液化
天然气出口增加，抑制了储气库注气量，为 160 亿立方米，比五年平
均水平低 25%。虽然注气放缓缓解了美国的储气过剩，但 9 月底的库
存水平仍比五年平均水平高出 5%，达到 81%的填充水平。相比之下，
6
常规天然气产量在预测期内将继续下降。预计到 2026 年，页岩气产
量将占美国天然气总产量的近 80%。
美国天然气产量增加主要由向全球天然气市场的 LNG 出口量增
加以及向墨西哥的管道天然气输送量增加驱动。天然气国内需求微弱
下降，出口强劲增长推动天然气生产，预计 2024 年产量增加。
（二）欧盟
1. 天然气市场供应紧张，LNG 成最大变量
欧盟 27 国本土天然气产量持续萎靡，荷兰格罗宁根气田关闭。
根据 Eurostat 数据，2023 年前九个月本土天然气产量 295 亿立方米，
相较 2021 年下降 23.37%，主要是因为欧洲最大天然气气田——荷兰
格罗宁根气田的关闭。根据路透社信息，格罗宁根气田 2023 年仅产
气 105 亿立方米，到 2024 年降为零，其他气田产气量同比下降 34.34%。
2024 年，预计欧盟天然气产量下行压力增大。
图 5 欧盟本土产量(数据来源：Eurostat)
俄乌冲突和挪威管道检修高位，管道气进口严重受限。根据
7
Eurostat 数据，2023 年前九个月欧盟总进口 3575 亿立方米，同比下
降 22.50%。Entsog 数据统计，2023 年前 50 周，LNG 进口占总量的
41.74%，为欧盟提供1274亿立方米的天然气。挪威占比第二为28.28%，
相比 2022 年下降 4.45%，主要是由于挪威管道夏季大量检修。受俄
乌冲突影响，由俄罗斯进口的天然气占比从 2021 年的 41.34%骤降至
9.18%，主要是因为俄罗斯管道气总供应量大幅下降——Tukstream 小
幅波动，Nord Stream和Yamal停气断供，Ukraine供应同比下降31.67%。
管道气被制约，LNG 成欧盟天然气最大变量，再气化产能利用
率成供给瓶颈信号灯。根据 GIE-ALSI 数据，2019-2021 年拥有 LNG
接收站的欧盟国家平均再气化产能利用率是 50.20%，2023 年上升至
66.31%。2023 年 9 月 19 日，欧盟与卡塔尔达成两项规模最大、期限
最长的 LNG 供应协议，与俄罗斯天然气“硬脱钩”。
图 6 欧盟进口来源情况(数据来源：Entsog)
地缘政治局势变化，进口 LNG 备受影响。红海航运危机持续，
中东 LNG 到欧洲的船运时间延长，成本增加。根据卓创资讯数据，
8
2023 年中东 LNG 流向欧洲的占比降至 13%，对应美国 LNG 去往欧
洲的占比增长至 41%。另外，巴以冲突升级将导致塔尔玛气田暂停生
产，使得以色列向埃及的出口大幅减少，进而间接影响埃及向欧洲出
口天然气。
2. 暖冬及经济复苏缓慢，天然气需求弱势
为应对地缘政治威胁、增强能源供应安全，欧盟确立自愿消减
15%天然气需求目标（相比过去五年的平均天然气消费量）。据
Eurostat 数据统计，截止 2023 年 9 月，欧盟共出口 1406 亿立方米天
然气（包括欧盟内部流通），比 2022 年前九个月下降 28.71%。欧盟
内陆消费量达 2345.62 亿立方米，同比下降 9.99%，相较 2021 年前九
个月的 2909.05 亿立方米减少 19.37%。
暖冬压制家庭取暖需求预期，天然气消费总体呈“U 型”季节性走
势。根据 Eurostat，2019-2022 年采暖季（每年 11 月到次年 3 月）平
均天然气消费量占当年总量的 56.03%，并逐年微弱抬升。
图 7 欧盟内陆消费(数据来源:Eurostat)
全球经济复苏缓慢且不均衡，因工厂关停或转向其他燃料，欧洲
9
工业需求受压制，预计 2024 年工业用气增速缓慢。根据 IMF 数据，
2022 年的全球经济增长率为 3.5%，预计 2024 年低至 2.9%。
电力方面，欧盟整体用电量减少，用气发电需求疲软，叠加可再
生能源发电持续建设。欧洲电力生产涉及多种能源，包括煤、石油、
天然气、可再生能源和生物质能等。根据 Eurostat 数据，截止 2023
年 8 月，净发电总量达 1704417.39 GWh，同比下降 4.42%，其中，
可再生能源发电占比高达 30.64%。天然气发电占比 17.34%，发电量
为 295540.453 GWh，较 2022 年下降 14.30%，主要由于水力、风力
和太阳能发电量平均同比上涨 11.44%，一定程度上替代气电需求。
3. 天然气保持库存高位，周环比下降
利用乌克兰库容增强储气，提供额外冬季保障。2023 年夏季开
始，欧盟向乌克兰反向输气，采暖季再从乌克兰气库提取天然气。根
据 GIE 数据，截止 2023 年 12 月初，欧盟天然气存储率达 88.69%，
同比上升 4.84%，高于前年 30.36%。AGSI 数据显示，2023 年 12 月，
欧盟天然气储气量达 989.97 亿立方米，比 2022 年同期增长 6.78%，
周环比下降 2.6%。欧盟接近满库入冬，无极端寒冷天气前提下将不
会发生气源短缺危机。
10
图 8 欧盟天然气储量(数据来源:AGSI)
注：最大值和最小值时间范围是 2015-2020
综上，红海危机持续、荷兰格罗宁根气田关闭、俄乌冲突长期持
续等多重因素交织影响下，2024 年，欧盟天然气供给端上行压力增
大，进口重心转移至美国和卡塔尔，与亚洲 LNG 市场竞争加大。值
得注意的是，供应端愈发依赖 LNG 意味着 TTF 价格波动易受外界扰
动影响。2024 年，欧盟成员国自愿削弱天然气需求目标延长，存气
省气节能，大力普及发展可再生能源，天然气需求受限。
（三）亚洲
1. 供给
1.1 日韩LNG进口小幅减少，中国LNG进口仍处在恢复阶段
2023年1-11月，日本共进口液化天然气59.39MT（百万吨），同比
下降9.93%；2023年1-10月，韩国共进口液化天然气35.71MT，同比减
少6.96%，主要由于相对温和的天气、工业需求疲软和核能供应增加。
2023年1-11月，中国共进口液化天然气63.06 MT，同比上升7.91%，
11
主要由于服务业的恢复、水电下降和夏季高温导致的发电用气量增长，
但尚未恢复到2021年同时期87.12MT的水平。
图9 2023年中日韩三国LNG进口量（数据来源：JOGMEC）
1.2 巴拿马运河拥堵限制美亚LNG贸易
2023年7月以来，巴拿马运河受罕见干旱影响，水位处以低位，
导致运河拥堵，船舶通行量下降，等待时间上升。根据巴拿马运河管
理机构公告，自2023年第四季度起，运河将进一步限制船舶通行数量
至18艘，仅为运河正常通行数量的一半。巴拿马运河是美国与东北亚
LNG贸易的重要通道，运河拥堵将降低运输效率，提升运输成本，限
制东北亚进口LNG供应。预计2024年，美亚LNG贸易将继续受限。
1.3 日韩天然气库存保持高位
经历了2022年的天然气短缺危机后，2023年日韩天然气库存处于
高位。截止2023年12月，日本发电用LNG库存量265万吨，高于2022
年与过去五年平均库存水平。截止2023年第三季度，韩国天然气天然
12
气库存量492.1万吨，同比增长23.8%。预计2024年，日韩天然气库存
仍将保持高位。

图11 韩国天然气库存情况（数据来源：KESIS）
2. 需求
2.1 日韩天然气消费萎靡，中国天然气恢复式增长
截止2023年7月，日本电力部门消费LNG20.79万吨，同比下降
23.8%，主要由于2023年核能发电的使用。城燃消费LNG17.29万吨，
同比下降10.78%。2023年前三季度，韩国天然气消费量3196万吨，同
13
比下降3.29%，主要来自城燃消费、制造业用气的减少。2023年，中
国天然气消费量约为3750亿立方米，主要增量来自于交通和公共服务
用气。
2.2 经济增长
内需旺盛，日本经济或将迎来温和复苏。2023年，日本经济表现
亮眼，前三季度实际GDP增速1.7%，主要得益于出口和强劲的消费。
据日本内阁数据，由于进口强势的预期，将2024年实际GDP增速从1.3%
上调至1.6%。预计2024年日本经济迎来温和复苏。
通胀走高，韩国经济发展面临压力。2023年，韩国高利率和高通
胀共存。自2022年以来，韩国央行已提高基准利率8次，但尚未缓解
通胀压力。2023年11月，韩国居民生活用电和燃气价格分别同比上涨
14%和5.6%。根据韩国央行预测，主要由于疲软的国内外需求和紧缩
性的货币政策，2024年经济增速从2.2%下调至2.1%。
2.3 核能发电发展
日韩非化石能源进一步发展。据日本能源经济部披露，2023年日
本重启三台核能发电设备平均运行9个月发电量为82.8TWh。据日本
能源经济部预计，2024年日本将重启三台核能发电设备，并将总运行
设备数量维持在16台。据韩国能源经济研究院披露，过去五年，韩国
核能发电年均增长率3.5%，可再生能源发电年均增长率9.6%。预计
2024年，日韩核能发电比例将继续提高。
2.4 天气因素
23年暖冬形式或将不再持续。据日本气象组织披露，2023年冬季
14
日本平均温度同比降低0.6摄氏度。同时，该组织预测，2024年夏季
和冬季平均温度将同比降低2.1摄氏度和0.3摄氏度。韩国能源经济研
究院披露，2023年韩国HDD为2372.9，低于2022年2567.1水平，并预
测2024年HDD为2433.9。预计2024年，日韩HDD水平将上升。
（四）中国
1. 经济恢复支撑天然气市场持续复苏
据上海石油天然气交易中心发布报告显示，2023 年 1-9 月我国天
然气消费量约 2709 亿立方米，2023 年全年天然气消费量约 3750 亿
立方米，同比增加 199 亿立方米，增幅 5.6%。天然气占一次能源消
费总量将达到 9.0%，增加 0.6 个百分点。由于 2022 年经济形势低迷，
天然气消费量受宏观经济影响首次下降，2023 年天然气市场增量以
恢复性增长为主，预计在 2022-2026 年期间，需求增长将保持强劲，
平均每年 8%。从消费结构来看，2023 年我国天然气消费以城市燃气
和工业燃料为主，占比之和约为 75%。2023 年城市燃气用气占比约
38.8%，增量达到 132 亿立方米。城市燃气增量主要来自交通（LNG
重卡销售火爆）和公共服务用气。公共服务用气同比增加 35 亿立方
米；交通用气同比大幅增加50亿立方米。工业燃料用气占比约36.4%，
同比下降1.6个百分点，工业用气增长不及预期，这主要受需求疲软、
出口放缓、库存堆积、气价偏高、煤炭政策宽松等因素影响，工业增
长乏力，2021 年全国规模以上工业增加值同比增长 9.6% ，2022 年
规模以上工业增加值增长 3.6%，2023 年全年工业增加值同比增长超
4.3%，不及预期。2023 年发电用气占总用气量的 16.9%，截至 2023
15
年底，我国天然气发电总装机容量 12219 万千瓦，占全国总装机的
4.4%，远低于四分之一左右的全球平均水平，预计到 2025 年，我国
天然气发电装机容量将会突破1.5亿千瓦，占总装机容量的6%左右。
2024 年,中国天然气发电需求量将持续上升。化工用气将占总用气量
的 8.0%。中国天然气市场发展总体平稳。2024 年中国经济有望在提
质增量中稳步前行，初步预计2024年全国天然气消费量3850亿~3900
亿立方米，增长主要受城市燃气和发电用气驱动。但预计随着上游成
本压力趋缓和中下游需求得到有效提振，工业经济有望持续恢复，从
而带动工业天然气需求增长。

2. 立足国内扩大生产，提升自主能力
2023 年以来，我国天然气产量快速增长。根据国家统计局数据
显示，2023 年 1-11 月份，天然气累计产量 2095.9 亿立方米，2022 年
1-11 月份为 1974.0 亿立方米，同比上涨 6.18%。2022 年 12 月 27 日
长庆油田成为了我国首个年产 500 亿立方米特大气区，每年增产天然
气超 20 亿立方米，累产超 6000 亿立方米。2023 年 12 月 14 日，西
16
南地区建成年产 400 亿立方米大气区，2023 年我国海洋油气产量有
望再创新高，新增产量19亿立方米,约占全国天然气产量增量的15%。
以能源饭碗牢牢地端在自己手里为目标，坚持加大油气资源勘探开发
和增储上产力度，体现了把能源保供稳价放在首位，提高安全保障水
平的基本原则。预计 2024 年中国天然气产量约为 2400 亿立方米。
图 13 中国天然气生产量(数据来源:国家统计局)
3. 天然气进口稳步增长
根据中商产业研究院研究报告，1-11 月我国天然气累计进口量
10739.7 万吨，同比增长 8.5%。2023 年 1—9 月天然气总进口量达 1208
亿立方米，同比增加 116 亿立方米，增幅 10.6%。其中：进口管道气
501 亿立方米，同比增加 23 亿立方米，增幅 4.8%，受俄乌冲突影响，
俄罗斯出口中国管道天然气逐年上涨，根据海关数据显示，2023 年 1
月-11 月，中国进口俄罗斯管道气价值总额合计 412 亿元，约为 2022
年全年的 1.5 倍。2022 年受世界 LNG 市场价格暴增影响，液化天然
气进口量大幅下降，2023 虽有所上升但进口 LNG 量仍不及 2021 年
水平，截至 2023 年 12 月 24 日，上海石油天然气交易中心中国 LNG
17
综合进口到岸价格指数为 178.46，同比下降 18.24%，中国作为进口
国，2023 年 1 月-11 月进口 LNG 货值约 2743 亿元，2022 年 1 月-11
月约为 3072 亿元，这主要得益于 2023 年整体气价趋于平稳。进口
LNG以长协为主导。2023年前三季度，我国LNG进口长协量为4099.8
万吨，同比增加 53%，占进口总量的 73.76%。2024 年长协净新增约
530 万吨。较 2023 年略有减少，预计 2024 年中国进口 LNG 量将会
达到 7900 万吨。

续增长。消费作为稳增长发展中的重要动力，是恢复经济中的稳大局者，
虽然正处于国内经济增速换挡与国外局势复杂多变的时期，但在扩内需、
促进国内大循环、建设全国统一大市场的政策推动下，消费潜力释放与结
构优化将会继续，预计2024年社零规模增速可达6.2%。
出口韧性凸显，预计2024年出口先跌后涨，全年出口增长2.0%。预计
2024年欧美降息确定性增强，并有望进入新一轮补库周期，同时进口需
求或有所回升。此外，“一带一路”进入第二个十年，我国将持续加强与
沿线国家的贸易合作，为我国出口增长提供新动能。

要。一是巩固经济回升向好态势仍需综合融资成本继续下行；二是政策利
率也有下行空间。②从量上看，配合积极财政政策实施，持续保持流动性合
理充裕，降准不可或缺；结构方面，盘活存量资金，加快培育新动能新优
势，精准支持重点领域和薄弱环节，结构性政策工具仍是主要抓手。
海外方面，美联储货币政策将转向降息，为我国央行释放操作空间。预计
美联储将在2024年3月开始降息，全年共降息3次左右，约有100-
150bps的降息空间。从基本面来看，有三点因素支撑美联储如期降息：
①美国消费有望逐步放缓。我们预计2024年美国居民超额储蓄将耗尽，
个税优惠幅度缩小，学贷压力将逐步增加，就业市场进一步放缓。我们判
断2024年美国经济增长趋势先高后低，预计全年经济增速在1.3-1.5%。
②通胀将进一步下行，或有小幅回弹。预计美国全年通胀中枢2.6%，基
数效应或使美国通胀中枢系统性抬升。核心商品通胀放缓趋势不变，住房
项或在三季度对通胀造成扰动。③就业市场趋于温和转弱。预计2024年
美国薪资增速将持续放缓，美国各类企业招聘需求回落，新增就业放缓，
就业缺口收窄。预计2024年失业率或达到4.4%，带动核心服务降通胀。
风险提示：国内经济复苏磨底；政策实施效果空间收窄；房产销售超预期
下降；三大工程实施亟需落地；企业投资意愿尚待好转；国际紧张局势加
剧；全球贸易环境复苏不及预期；美国经济政策超预期。

Trends Impacting CCOs in 2024
In 2024, CCOs face heightened demands from regulators and enforcement agencies for program effectiveness,
with many in the U.S. also facing an expanded duty of oversight. They must meet these demands all while
navigating increasing risk management volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity — “VUCA” — across the
organization and the extended enterprise.

Challenge: Significant Effort Spent on KRIs
CCOs tell us they spend significant effort reviewing KRIs — key risk events and other risk hot spots — to evaluate
their compliance program performance. Yet, despite those investments, there’s little correlation between effort
expended here and CCO confidence in program effectiveness.

2024 年成品油价格分析与趋势预测
一、成品油价格走势回顾
石油化工行业是国民经济的重要支柱。成品油作为核心产品，对
各行业经济发展起到不可或缺的支撑作用。然而，成品油市场产业链
条长、产品种类多、关联覆盖广，市场供需受国内外宏观经济、政策
等因素影响，价格具有波动性和复杂性特征。根据流通环节和销售方
式不同，成品油价格分为供应价格、批发价格和零售价格。其中，成
品油批发价不仅直接影响生产成本和盈利能力，还决定零售价格的高
低，从而影响终端消费用油成本。本报告将针对汽油、柴油两种主要
成品油的批发价格进行深入分析和预测。
（一）汽油价格演变历程及2023年走势
汽油作为一种重要燃料，与交通运输、仓储和邮政等行业生产活
动密切相关。汽油价格受国际油价、国内供需关系、替代能源发展等
因素影响。下面以92号汽油批发价为例，根据其历史价格与国际油价
走势，将我国汽油价格演变历程分为四个阶段（图1）。
第一，2005年-2011年，汽油批发价波动上涨。国内经济高速增长，
汽油供不应求，批发价从2005年的4979元/吨稳步上涨至2008年的
7081元/吨，涨幅达42%。随后受金融危机影响，国际油价下跌。与此
同时，国内汽车市场销售低迷，汽油需求疲软，2009年汽油批发价跌
至年均6852元/吨。2010年全球经济复苏，国际油价震荡上行，国内汽
车销量增长，汽油消费强劲，价格上升，2011年增长至9381元/吨。
1
第二，2012年-2014年，汽油批发价较为稳定。随着石油行业新建
大型炼油项目相继投产，国内炼油能力大幅提高，替代能源增长较快，
汽油产量略高于需求，市场维持宽平衡，批发价稳定在年均9300元/吨
左右。
第三，2015年-2018年，汽油批发价先降后升。受美国页岩革命、
欧佩克主要产油国增产等因素影响，原油库存持续走高，国际油价承
压下挫，汽油成本降低。国内市场供大于求局面持续，对汽油价格形
成下行压力，2016年降至6692元/吨。受欧佩克等主要产油国减产和中
美贸易摩擦等不确定性因素冲击，国际油价2016年之后触底回弹，
2018年汽油批发价涨至8836元/吨。
第四，2019年-2023年，汽油批发价震荡上涨。2019年末，公共卫
生事件爆发，汽油需求下降，平均批发价于2020年跌至6748元/吨。随
后经济逐渐复苏，汽油需求回暖，拉动价格上涨。2022年，俄乌冲突
引发能源危机，原油供应短缺、市场避险情绪等推动国际原油价格上
涨，拉高汽油生产成本及价格，年均批发价超10000元/吨。2023年，
受供需基本面因素影响，国际油价回落，汽油批发价同步下降。

2023 年，受国际油价波动、新能源汽车持续发力等因素影响，汽
油批发价表现为上半年震荡显著，下半年大幅攀升后波动下行。2023
年汽油年均批发价格为 9659 元/吨，较 2022 年下降 5%。2023 年我国
汽油月度批发价格如图 2 所示。
具体分析如下：
1-3 月，汽油批发价先涨后跌，季度均价为 9557 元/吨。年初，国
际原油市场供应紧张、地缘政治风险持续；国内疫情结束需求恢复，
春运假期提振出行需求，支撑汽油消费；供需基本面等多重因素作用
汽油批发价小幅上涨，2 月价格达到 9627 元/吨，较 1 月涨幅 1.5%。
3 月，汽油供应逐渐增长，批发价小幅跌至 9562 元/吨。
4-6 月，汽油批发价宽幅震荡，季度均价为 9399 元/吨。国际上，
地缘政治风险缓解，原油供应逐渐恢复，汽油成本下降，价格承压下
行。5 月降至年度最低，6 月均价跌至 9291 元/吨。

（二）柴油价格演变历程及2023年走势
柴油作为我国重工业产业的重要生产资料，2005年以来占成品油
消费比重超过50%。柴油价格主要受国际油价、国内供需关系等因素
影响。下面将以0号柴油批发价为例，根据其历史价格与国际油价走
势，将我国柴油批发价格演变历程分为四个阶段（图3）。
第一，2005 年-2011 年，柴油批发价波动增长。2008 年受国际金
融危机影响，成品油需求明显下降。柴油批发价受国际油价影响震荡
变动。2009 年柴油批发价同比下降 21%。由于地缘事件冲击导致部
4
分产油国原油产量下降，国际油价上升，柴油批发价同步增长，2011
年增长至 8119 元/吨，环比上升约 17%。
第二，2012 年-2014 年，柴油批发价趋于稳定。汽油代替柴油逐
步成为我国经济增长的主要驱动力，柴油供需增长放缓。国际石油供
需相对宽松，国际油价略有回落，2012 年-2014 年柴油批发价小幅度
下降，稳定在 8000 元/吨左右。
第三，2015 年-2018 年，柴油批发价先降后升。2014 年，我国开
放原油进口权和资质，民营炼化开始扩张，市场供过于求，柴油批发
价 2016 年下跌至 5524 元/吨。2017 年，受欧佩克和俄罗斯等主要产
油国减产、中美贸易摩擦等因素影响，国际油价再次上升，对柴油批
发价形成支撑，2017 年和 2018 年柴油批发价平均增速达 15%。
第四，2019 年-2022 年，柴油批发价震荡上行。受疫情影响，国
内柴油需求疲软，柴油产量自 2016 年后首次出现负增长，柴油批发
价于 2020 年下降至 5888 元/吨。随着全球经济逐渐恢复以及俄乌冲
突等因素影响，国际油价上涨。同时我国经济逐步克服疫情不利影响，
柴油批发价逐步回升至 8798 元/吨。2022 年美国释放战略原油储备，
国际油价回落。

图3 2005-2023年柴油批发价格与国际油价走势（数据来源：WIND）
2023年柴油批发价年均价格为8295元/吨，较2022年下降5.7%。
年初，随着疫情防控解除、国际原油价格回升，柴油批发价呈小幅上
升；随后受国际油价下跌、柴油市场供过于求等因素影响，柴油批发
价呈下降趋势；7-8 月，随着柴油需求回升，加之柴油市场出口增长
等利好因素，柴油批发价呈增长趋势，并在 10 月份达到全年最高水
平 8745 元/吨；10-12 月，国际原油价格下跌叠加柴油需求疲软，柴
油批发价下滑。2023 年国内柴油月度批发价格如图 4 所示。
具体分析如下：
1-6 月，柴油批发价小幅上涨后下跌。随着疫情管控解除，国内
企业复工复产，物流、基建投资以及春耕生产等增加柴油需求。柴油
批发价格在 2 月份小幅上涨至 8296 元/吨，与年均批发价水平保持一
致。受全球经济放缓、供需基本面、美联储货币政策等因素影响，上
半年国际原油价格震荡下跌。根据卓创数据，1-6 月，我国柴油累计
产量超 10746 万吨，累计增长 21.7%；表观消费量达 9981 万吨。总

7-9 月，柴油批发价呈上涨态势。三季度，国际市场上，受地缘
政治紧张、产油国大幅减产影响，国际油价上涨。受国内促消费经济
政策刺激，基建工程及物流运输活跃，用油需求增加。柴油需求涨幅
高于供应，批发价攀升。7-9 月柴油批发价连续上涨至 8709 元/吨。
10-12 月，柴油批发价持续下降。四季度，市场原油供大于求，
国际原油价格震荡下跌。受冬季气温影响，户外终端用油单位开工受
限，柴油消费相关行业用油需求低迷，柴油批发价持续下降，从 8745
元/吨降至 8271 元/吨。

二、2024年成品油市场形势分析
2024年我国经济保持回升向好态势，在积极稳妥推进“双碳”目
标背景下，成品油市场高质量发展进程加快。在生产方面，“双碳”目
7
标严控新增产能，汽油生产增速放缓，柴油生产小幅下降；需求方面，
在新能源车市占率扩大、基建投资增加、乡村振兴战略等多重因素叠
加下，汽油消费增速放缓、柴油消费或有扩张；在进出口方面，为保
障能源安全，成品油出口配额调控将进一步加强，汽油净出口同比持
平、柴油净出口同比降低。此外，叠加汇率波动、地缘政治风险、环
保政策收紧等因素，2024年国际原油价格仍面临较大不确定性。2024
年，成品油市场砥砺前行，汽油供需趋于宽松，柴油供需偏紧。
（一）成品油市场基本面分析
1、“双碳”严控新增炼油产能，汽油产量增速放缓
我国炼油能力十余年来快速增长，2022年国内炼油总能力约9.24
亿吨，成为世界第一炼油大国。2005-2023年，汽油产量由0.54亿吨增
加至1.6亿吨，年均增速6.2%（图5）。在疫情防控解除、经济回暖等因
素提振下，炼厂平均开工率由2022年的67.8%上涨至2023年的72.6%，
汽油产量同比上升10%。《2030年前碳达峰行动方案》明确要求到2025
年原油一次加工能力控制在10亿吨以内，相比2022年9.24亿吨的炼油
能力，仅有不到1亿吨的增长空间。2023年国家发改委、能源局等部
门针对炼油行业出台《关于促进炼油行业绿色创新高质量发展的指导
意见》，部署17项重点任务，进一步明确严控新增炼油产能、加快淘
汰落后产能。按照政策要求，2024年不符合国家产业政策的200万吨/
年及以下常减压装置将有序淘汰，炼油行业规模化、一体化布局加快。
“双碳”目标下，未来我国炼油能力增长空间有限，叠加严控新增产
能等多重因素，汽油生产增速放缓。预计2024年汽油生产增速4.3%，

2、柴油标准升级叠加政府加强监管，柴油产量小幅下降
我国柴油产量呈波动上升趋势（图6）。2005-2017年，柴油产量快
速增长，年均增速达4.4%。2018年，国际油价上涨等因素推高柴油生
产成本，炼厂开工率保持低位，柴油产量下降。2021-2023年，柴油产
量由1.68亿吨快速回升至2.18亿吨。然而，在深入推进环境污染防治、
持续深入打好蓝天保卫战的背景下，柴油尾气污染源成为大气污染防
治攻坚重要目标。日益趋严的柴油车排放法规加快成品油质量升级。
2023年7月，国六b标准全面实施，加速淘汰工业设备落后的旧小产能、
促进炼厂工艺优化，减少非正规炼厂低质量柴油生产。同时，为规范
柴油市场，对于柴油生产、储存、使用、经营、运输等环节的管控收
紧。综合柴油标准升级、政府加强监管等因素，预计2024年柴油产量
将小幅下降至2.12亿吨，同比下降2.4%。

3、新能源汽车持续发力，汽油需求增速显著放缓
随着经济快速发展，我国汽油消费量不断攀升（图7）。2005-2023
年汽油消费总量由0.49亿吨上升至1.46亿吨，平均增速6.3%。汽油需
求主要来自交通运输及居民生活用油，占比由2005年的57%增长至
2023年的73%。随着新冠疫情防控转段后经济恢复发展，汽油消费维
持稳定复苏态势。2023年汽油消费总量达1.46亿吨，同比增长7.6%。
其中，交通运输及居民生活汽油消费分别同比增长4.1%和1.5%。2024
年经济持续回升向好，为汽油需求增长提供支撑。而随着新能源汽车
渗透率的提高，汽油需求整体增量有限，交通和居民生活用油需求或
达1.07亿吨，同比增长0.4%和2.3%。其中，交通业增速较2023年下降
3.7%，居民生活汽油消费量增速较2023年上升0.8%。总体而言，疫后
经济复苏、车用燃料清洁替代等因素共同影响下，预计2024年汽油总
消费量为1.48亿吨，较2023年增加1.2%，增速较2023年降低6.5%，增
速显著放缓。

4、基建投资增加推高客货运需求，提振柴油消费
随着经济发展，我国柴油消费呈波动上升趋势（图8）。2005-2023
年柴油消费总量由1.10亿吨上升至1.93亿吨，平均增速3.2%。交通运
输作为最主要的柴油消费终端，2023年占比高达73%。随着国家促消
费新政策陆续出台，2023年货运及大型客车运输需求增长，交通柴油
消费达1.41亿吨，同比增长7%。2023年10月，人大常委会表决通过《关
于批准国务院增发国债和2023年中央预算调整方案的决议》，刺激基
建投资，拉动货运及柴油需求，预计2024年交通业柴油需求约1.59亿
吨，同比增长12.5%。乡村振兴及现代化农业发展或将提振农业机械
设备需求，而新型农机普及和节能技术发展将替代部分柴油需求，农
业柴油消费同比减少46.7万吨。总体而言，经济政策利好促进柴油需
求增加，叠加物流和户外基建工程用油刚需支撑，预计2024年柴油总
消费量约为2.08亿吨，较2023年增加8%。

5、成品油库存充裕，支撑调节成品油供应能力
成品油库存支撑调节供应能力。2023年底，汽油库存达1336万吨，
同比去年下跌15.5%。汽油库存全年震荡下降，维持历史低位（图9）。
主要原因在于年初国内疫情防控解除、汽油需求迅速恢复，导致短时
间内汽油生产不及销售，库存下降。9-12月，汽油库存呈现波动微涨。
预计2024年汽油库存继续回升，供给调节能力逐步恢复。柴油库存处
于相对高位。2023年1-4月柴油库存由1438万吨快速上涨至1650万吨，
之后高位徘徊。年末柴油消费复苏，库存高位回调。12月底库存1512
万吨，同比上升3.3%。汽柴油库存年中差距不断拉大，年末库存差距
有所缩小。预计2024年柴油库存小幅回调但仍相对充裕，对调节供给
提供有效支撑。

6、保障能源安全背景下，加强稳妥调控成品油出口
中国大型炼厂建设和技术装备世界领先，炼厂产能不断提升。为
解决成品油产能过剩，2016年国家提高成品油出口退税率刺激出口，
汽柴油净出口分别由2015年的572万吨和660万吨上升至2019年的
1604万吨和2045万吨，平均增速约30%（图10）。2019年后，受“双碳”
目标、消费需求增长、炼厂转型叠加疫情影响，汽柴油净出口整体呈
下降趋势。此外，油价高位波动背景下，成品油大量进口或出口不利
于保障我国能源安全，出口配额收紧成为近年来国家油气体制改革的
主要内容之一。2022年后汽油净出口有所回升。而国内柴油消费提振
则将导致柴油净出口量持续下滑。总体而言，成品油净出口量整体稳
中有降，预计2024年汽油净出口量1554万吨，与2023年基本持平；柴
油净出口338万吨，较2023年减少492万吨。

（二）成品油市场非基本面分析
1、原油价格偏弱运行，成品油价格震荡下行
原油作为炼油工业的原料，其价格直接影响汽油、柴油批发价格。
2023年国际原油市场供需两弱，地缘政治因素持续扰动，油价区间波
动。展望2024年，全球宏观经济增长动力不足，原油需求整体疲软；
欧佩克减产政策对油价支撑逐步减弱，非欧佩克国家原油产量保持增
长，供应调控空间宽松；国际原油价格中枢呈下降趋势。美联储降息
预期增强，多重利好支撑人民币汇率走强，原油进口成本及成品油价
格或将随国际油价下调。
2、地缘政治风险增加成品油价格波动不确定性
俄乌冲突以来，俄罗斯石油出口受阻，叠加避险情绪推动国际原
油价格上涨，原油市场供需趋紧，缩减成品油市场供应，推升汽油、
柴油等价格短期快速上涨。2023年10月初巴以冲突爆发，市场情绪低
14
迷；红海商船大面积停运致使石油运费成本攀升，推高短期国际油价。
但冲突尚未扩散至伊朗等重要油气出口国或运输通道，对原油市场冲
击有限。展望2024年，全球将举行40余场大选，包括美国、印度、俄
罗斯、乌克兰、墨西哥等，将对地缘政治格局产生深刻影响。多国大
选增加了宏观经济、地缘政治、能源供需等方面的不确定性，间接传
导成品油市场，短期内将放大成品油价格震荡区间。
3、环保政策趋严，或将加剧成品油价格波动
为推动空气质量持续改善、保障居民健康，国家和地方政府环保
政策趋严。收紧的环保政策冲击成品油的生产和需求，增加汽油、柴
油价格形势不确定性。如北京市将于2024年7月率先执行国家在用汽
油车和柴油车排放标限值b，不同污染物均比限值a严格30%-50%，涉
及北京市注册登记或在北京使用的外地车辆。这一政策将加速淘汰不
符合要求的汽油及柴油车，对短期汽柴油需求产生负面冲击。同时，
2023年7月在全国范围执行的国六b标准等环境政策也会对汽车及炼
化行业产生影响，进而加大成品油价格不确定性。
三、2024年成品油价格走势综合判断
2024 年，炼油行业加快推进绿色高质量发展。“双碳”目标下严
控新增炼油产能，汽油产能扩张受限。柴油库存相对高位，加之有序
淘汰落后装置，柴油产量或迎小幅下降。国内经济回升向好，有望提
振成品油消费市场活力。新能源汽车市场持续发力，交通运输及居民
生活用油清洁替代加快。汽油库存回升，支撑调节汽油供应。随着基
建投资力度加大，拉动客货运及柴油需求增长。在保障能源安全背景
15
下，我国进一步加强成品油出口配额调控。展望 2024 年成品油市场，
汽油供需趋于宽松，柴油供需偏紧。
2024 年，俄乌冲突以及红海危机将影响全球能源市场。地缘政治
风险加大原油价格震荡区间。原油基本面支撑国际油价中枢下移。全
球经济下行压力下，美联储降息预期增强，美元指数走弱，加剧原油
价格走弱对国内成品油价格带来的下行压力。另外，随着环保政策趋
严，机动车辆排放标准提高，或将加剧成品油市场价格波动风险。

2024 年成品油价格分析与趋势预测
一、成品油价格走势回顾
石油化工行业是国民经济的重要支柱。成品油作为核心产品，对
各行业经济发展起到不可或缺的支撑作用。然而，成品油市场产业链
条长、产品种类多、关联覆盖广，市场供需受国内外宏观经济、政策
等因素影响，价格具有波动性和复杂性特征。根据流通环节和销售方
式不同，成品油价格分为供应价格、批发价格和零售价格。其中，成
品油批发价不仅直接影响生产成本和盈利能力，还决定零售价格的高
低，从而影响终端消费用油成本。本报告将针对汽油、柴油两种主要
成品油的批发价格进行深入分析和预测。
（一）汽油价格演变历程及2023年走势
汽油作为一种重要燃料，与交通运输、仓储和邮政等行业生产活
动密切相关。汽油价格受国际油价、国内供需关系、替代能源发展等
因素影响。下面以92号汽油批发价为例，根据其历史价格与国际油价
走势，将我国汽油价格演变历程分为四个阶段（图1）。
第一，2005年-2011年，汽油批发价波动上涨。国内经济高速增长，
汽油供不应求，批发价从2005年的4979元/吨稳步上涨至2008年的
7081元/吨，涨幅达42%。随后受金融危机影响，国际油价下跌。与此
同时，国内汽车市场销售低迷，汽油需求疲软，2009年汽油批发价跌
至年均6852元/吨。2010年全球经济复苏，国际油价震荡上行，国内汽
车销量增长，汽油消费强劲，价格上升，2011年增长至9381元/吨。
1
第二，2012年-2014年，汽油批发价较为稳定。随着石油行业新建
大型炼油项目相继投产，国内炼油能力大幅提高，替代能源增长较快，
汽油产量略高于需求，市场维持宽平衡，批发价稳定在年均9300元/吨
左右。
第三，2015年-2018年，汽油批发价先降后升。受美国页岩革命、
欧佩克主要产油国增产等因素影响，原油库存持续走高，国际油价承
压下挫，汽油成本降低。国内市场供大于求局面持续，对汽油价格形
成下行压力，2016年降至6692元/吨。受欧佩克等主要产油国减产和中
美贸易摩擦等不确定性因素冲击，国际油价2016年之后触底回弹，
2018年汽油批发价涨至8836元/吨。
第四，2019年-2023年，汽油批发价震荡上涨。2019年末，公共卫
生事件爆发，汽油需求下降，平均批发价于2020年跌至6748元/吨。随
后经济逐渐复苏，汽油需求回暖，拉动价格上涨。2022年，俄乌冲突
引发能源危机，原油供应短缺、市场避险情绪等推动国际原油价格上
涨，拉高汽油生产成本及价格，年均批发价超10000元/吨。2023年，
受供需基本面因素影响，国际油价回落，汽油批发价同步下降。

图1 2005-2023年汽油批发价格与国际油价走势（数据来源：WIND）
2023 年，受国际油价波动、新能源汽车持续发力等因素影响，汽
油批发价表现为上半年震荡显著，下半年大幅攀升后波动下行。2023
年汽油年均批发价格为 9659 元/吨，较 2022 年下降 5%。2023 年我国
汽油月度批发价格如图 2 所示。
具体分析如下：
1-3 月，汽油批发价先涨后跌，季度均价为 9557 元/吨。年初，国
际原油市场供应紧张、地缘政治风险持续；国内疫情结束需求恢复，
春运假期提振出行需求，支撑汽油消费；供需基本面等多重因素作用
汽油批发价小幅上涨，2 月价格达到 9627 元/吨，较 1 月涨幅 1.5%。

（二）柴油价格演变历程及2023年走势
柴油作为我国重工业产业的重要生产资料，2005年以来占成品油
消费比重超过50%。柴油价格主要受国际油价、国内供需关系等因素
影响。下面将以0号柴油批发价为例，根据其历史价格与国际油价走
势，将我国柴油批发价格演变历程分为四个阶段（图3）。
第一，2005 年-2011 年，柴油批发价波动增长。2008 年受国际金
融危机影响，成品油需求明显下降。柴油批发价受国际油价影响震荡
变动。2009 年柴油批发价同比下降 21%。由于地缘事件冲击导致部
4
分产油国原油产量下降，国际油价上升，柴油批发价同步增长，2011
年增长至 8119 元/吨，环比上升约 17%。
第二，2012 年-2014 年，柴油批发价趋于稳定。汽油代替柴油逐
步成为我国经济增长的主要驱动力，柴油供需增长放缓。国际石油供
需相对宽松，国际油价略有回落，2012 年-2014 年柴油批发价小幅度
下降，稳定在 8000 元/吨左右。
第三，2015 年-2018 年，柴油批发价先降后升。2014 年，我国开
放原油进口权和资质，民营炼化开始扩张，市场供过于求，柴油批发
价 2016 年下跌至 5524 元/吨。2017 年，受欧佩克和俄罗斯等主要产
油国减产、中美贸易摩擦等因素影响，国际油价再次上升，对柴油批
发价形成支撑，2017 年和 2018 年柴油批发价平均增速达 15%。
第四，2019 年-2022 年，柴油批发价震荡上行。受疫情影响，国
内柴油需求疲软，柴油产量自 2016 年后首次出现负增长，柴油批发
价于 2020 年下降至 5888 元/吨。随着全球经济逐渐恢复以及俄乌冲
突等因素影响，国际油价上涨。同时我国经济逐步克服疫情不利影响，
柴油批发价逐步回升至 8798 元/吨。2022 年美国释放战略原油储备，
国际油价回落。

2023年柴油批发价年均价格为8295元/吨，较2022年下降5.7%。
年初，随着疫情防控解除、国际原油价格回升，柴油批发价呈小幅上
升；随后受国际油价下跌、柴油市场供过于求等因素影响，柴油批发
价呈下降趋势；7-8 月，随着柴油需求回升，加之柴油市场出口增长
等利好因素，柴油批发价呈增长趋势，并在 10 月份达到全年最高水
平 8745 元/吨；10-12 月，国际原油价格下跌叠加柴油需求疲软，柴
油批发价下滑。2023 年国内柴油月度批发价格如图 4 所示。
具体分析如下：
1-6 月，柴油批发价小幅上涨后下跌。随着疫情管控解除，国内
企业复工复产，物流、基建投资以及春耕生产等增加柴油需求。柴油
批发价格在 2 月份小幅上涨至 8296 元/吨，与年均批发价水平保持一
致。受全球经济放缓、供需基本面、美联储货币政策等因素影响，上
半年国际原油价格震荡下跌。根据卓创数据，1-6 月，我国柴油累计
产量超 10746 万吨，累计增长 21.7%；表观消费量达 9981 万吨。总

二、2024年成品油市场形势分析
2024年我国经济保持回升向好态势，在积极稳妥推进“双碳”目
标背景下，成品油市场高质量发展进程加快。在生产方面，“双碳”目
7
标严控新增产能，汽油生产增速放缓，柴油生产小幅下降；需求方面，
在新能源车市占率扩大、基建投资增加、乡村振兴战略等多重因素叠
加下，汽油消费增速放缓、柴油消费或有扩张；在进出口方面，为保
障能源安全，成品油出口配额调控将进一步加强，汽油净出口同比持
平、柴油净出口同比降低。此外，叠加汇率波动、地缘政治风险、环
保政策收紧等因素，2024年国际原油价格仍面临较大不确定性。2024
年，成品油市场砥砺前行，汽油供需趋于宽松，柴油供需偏紧。
（一）成品油市场基本面分析
1、“双碳”严控新增炼油产能，汽油产量增速放缓
我国炼油能力十余年来快速增长，2022年国内炼油总能力约9.24
亿吨，成为世界第一炼油大国。2005-2023年，汽油产量由0.54亿吨增
加至1.6亿吨，年均增速6.2%（图5）。在疫情防控解除、经济回暖等因
素提振下，炼厂平均开工率由2022年的67.8%上涨至2023年的72.6%，
汽油产量同比上升10%。《2030年前碳达峰行动方案》明确要求到2025
年原油一次加工能力控制在10亿吨以内，相比2022年9.24亿吨的炼油
能力，仅有不到1亿吨的增长空间。2023年国家发改委、能源局等部
门针对炼油行业出台《关于促进炼油行业绿色创新高质量发展的指导
意见》，部署17项重点任务，进一步明确严控新增炼油产能、加快淘
汰落后产能。按照政策要求，2024年不符合国家产业政策的200万吨/
年及以下常减压装置将有序淘汰，炼油行业规模化、一体化布局加快。
“双碳”目标下，未来我国炼油能力增长空间有限，叠加严控新增产
能等多重因素，汽油生产增速放缓。预计2024年汽油生产增速4.3%，

2、柴油标准升级叠加政府加强监管，柴油产量小幅下降
我国柴油产量呈波动上升趋势（图6）。2005-2017年，柴油产量快
速增长，年均增速达4.4%。2018年，国际油价上涨等因素推高柴油生
产成本，炼厂开工率保持低位，柴油产量下降。2021-2023年，柴油产
量由1.68亿吨快速回升至2.18亿吨。然而，在深入推进环境污染防治、
持续深入打好蓝天保卫战的背景下，柴油尾气污染源成为大气污染防
治攻坚重要目标。日益趋严的柴油车排放法规加快成品油质量升级。
2023年7月，国六b标准全面实施，加速淘汰工业设备落后的旧小产能、
促进炼厂工艺优化，减少非正规炼厂低质量柴油生产。同时，为规范
柴油市场，对于柴油生产、储存、使用、经营、运输等环节的管控收
紧。综合柴油标准升级、政府加强监管等因素，预计2024年柴油产量
将小幅下降至2.12亿吨，同比下降2.4%。

3、新能源汽车持续发力，汽油需求增速显著放缓
随着经济快速发展，我国汽油消费量不断攀升（图7）。2005-2023
年汽油消费总量由0.49亿吨上升至1.46亿吨，平均增速6.3%。汽油需
求主要来自交通运输及居民生活用油，占比由2005年的57%增长至
2023年的73%。随着新冠疫情防控转段后经济恢复发展，汽油消费维
持稳定复苏态势。2023年汽油消费总量达1.46亿吨，同比增长7.6%。
其中，交通运输及居民生活汽油消费分别同比增长4.1%和1.5%。2024
年经济持续回升向好，为汽油需求增长提供支撑。而随着新能源汽车
渗透率的提高，汽油需求整体增量有限，交通和居民生活用油需求或
达1.07亿吨，同比增长0.4%和2.3%。其中，交通业增速较2023年下降
3.7%，居民生活汽油消费量增速较2023年上升0.8%。总体而言，疫后
经济复苏、车用燃料清洁替代等因素共同影响下，预计2024年汽油总
消费量为1.48亿吨，较2023年增加1.2%，增速较2023年降低6.5%，增
速显著放缓。

4、基建投资增加推高客货运需求，提振柴油消费
随着经济发展，我国柴油消费呈波动上升趋势（图8）。2005-2023
年柴油消费总量由1.10亿吨上升至1.93亿吨，平均增速3.2%。交通运
输作为最主要的柴油消费终端，2023年占比高达73%。随着国家促消
费新政策陆续出台，2023年货运及大型客车运输需求增长，交通柴油
消费达1.41亿吨，同比增长7%。2023年10月，人大常委会表决通过《关
于批准国务院增发国债和2023年中央预算调整方案的决议》，刺激基
建投资，拉动货运及柴油需求，预计2024年交通业柴油需求约1.59亿
吨，同比增长12.5%。乡村振兴及现代化农业发展或将提振农业机械
设备需求，而新型农机普及和节能技术发展将替代部分柴油需求，农
业柴油消费同比减少46.7万吨。总体而言，经济政策利好促进柴油需
求增加，叠加物流和户外基建工程用油刚需支撑，预计2024年柴油总
消费量约为2.08亿吨，较2023年增加8%。

5、成品油库存充裕，支撑调节成品油供应能力
成品油库存支撑调节供应能力。2023年底，汽油库存达1336万吨，
同比去年下跌15.5%。汽油库存全年震荡下降，维持历史低位（图9）。
主要原因在于年初国内疫情防控解除、汽油需求迅速恢复，导致短时
间内汽油生产不及销售，库存下降。9-12月，汽油库存呈现波动微涨。
预计2024年汽油库存继续回升，供给调节能力逐步恢复。柴油库存处
于相对高位。2023年1-4月柴油库存由1438万吨快速上涨至1650万吨，
之后高位徘徊。年末柴油消费复苏，库存高位回调。12月底库存1512
万吨，同比上升3.3%。汽柴油库存年中差距不断拉大，年末库存差距
有所缩小。预计2024年柴油库存小幅回调但仍相对充裕，对调节供给
提供有效支撑。

6、保障能源安全背景下，加强稳妥调控成品油出口
中国大型炼厂建设和技术装备世界领先，炼厂产能不断提升。为
解决成品油产能过剩，2016年国家提高成品油出口退税率刺激出口，
汽柴油净出口分别由2015年的572万吨和660万吨上升至2019年的
1604万吨和2045万吨，平均增速约30%（图10）。2019年后，受“双碳”
目标、消费需求增长、炼厂转型叠加疫情影响，汽柴油净出口整体呈
下降趋势。此外，油价高位波动背景下，成品油大量进口或出口不利
于保障我国能源安全，出口配额收紧成为近年来国家油气体制改革的
主要内容之一。2022年后汽油净出口有所回升。而国内柴油消费提振
则将导致柴油净出口量持续下滑。总体而言，成品油净出口量整体稳
中有降，预计2024年汽油净出口量1554万吨，与2023年基本持平；柴
油净出口338万吨，较2023年减少492万吨。

（二）成品油市场非基本面分析
1、原油价格偏弱运行，成品油价格震荡下行
原油作为炼油工业的原料，其价格直接影响汽油、柴油批发价格。
2023年国际原油市场供需两弱，地缘政治因素持续扰动，油价区间波
动。展望2024年，全球宏观经济增长动力不足，原油需求整体疲软；
欧佩克减产政策对油价支撑逐步减弱，非欧佩克国家原油产量保持增
长，供应调控空间宽松；国际原油价格中枢呈下降趋势。美联储降息
预期增强，多重利好支撑人民币汇率走强，原油进口成本及成品油价
格或将随国际油价下调。
2、地缘政治风险增加成品油价格波动不确定性
俄乌冲突以来，俄罗斯石油出口受阻，叠加避险情绪推动国际原
油价格上涨，原油市场供需趋紧，缩减成品油市场供应，推升汽油、
柴油等价格短期快速上涨。2023年10月初巴以冲突爆发，市场情绪低
14
迷；红海商船大面积停运致使石油运费成本攀升，推高短期国际油价。
但冲突尚未扩散至伊朗等重要油气出口国或运输通道，对原油市场冲
击有限。展望2024年，全球将举行40余场大选，包括美国、印度、俄
罗斯、乌克兰、墨西哥等，将对地缘政治格局产生深刻影响。多国大
选增加了宏观经济、地缘政治、能源供需等方面的不确定性，间接传
导成品油市场，短期内将放大成品油价格震荡区间。
3、环保政策趋严，或将加剧成品油价格波动
为推动空气质量持续改善、保障居民健康，国家和地方政府环保
政策趋严。收紧的环保政策冲击成品油的生产和需求，增加汽油、柴
油价格形势不确定性。如北京市将于2024年7月率先执行国家在用汽
油车和柴油车排放标限值b，不同污染物均比限值a严格30%-50%，涉
及北京市注册登记或在北京使用的外地车辆。这一政策将加速淘汰不
符合要求的汽油及柴油车，对短期汽柴油需求产生负面冲击。同时，
2023年7月在全国范围执行的国六b标准等环境政策也会对汽车及炼
化行业产生影响，进而加大成品油价格不确定性。
三、2024年成品油价格走势综合判断
2024 年，炼油行业加快推进绿色高质量发展。“双碳”目标下严
控新增炼油产能，汽油产能扩张受限。柴油库存相对高位，加之有序
淘汰落后装置，柴油产量或迎小幅下降。国内经济回升向好，有望提
振成品油消费市场活力。新能源汽车市场持续发力，交通运输及居民
生活用油清洁替代加快。汽油库存回升，支撑调节汽油供应。随着基
建投资力度加大，拉动客货运及柴油需求增长。在保障能源安全背景
15
下，我国进一步加强成品油出口配额调控。展望 2024 年成品油市场，
汽油供需趋于宽松，柴油供需偏紧。
2024 年，俄乌冲突以及红海危机将影响全球能源市场。地缘政治
风险加大原油价格震荡区间。原油基本面支撑国际油价中枢下移。全
球经济下行压力下，美联储降息预期增强，美元指数走弱，加剧原油
价格走弱对国内成品油价格带来的下行压力。另外，随着环保政策趋
严，机动车辆排放标准提高，或将加剧成品油市场价格波动风险。

14 Takeaways from the
Activate Technology & Media Outlook 2024
Consumer Time and Attention: Activate’s analysis of consumer technology and media activity
shows that multitasking leads to a nearly 32-hour day for the average American, with over 13 hours
spent using technology and media. By 2027, we project that time spend with technology and media
will increase by 12 minutes a day.
Super Users: To drive growth, the imperative for technology and media companies will be to
identify, reach, and super-serve Super Users – the segment of power users who account for a
disproportionately high share of time and spend across technology and media activities, including
AR/VR, eCommerce, gaming, generative AI, live events, messaging and social media, Metaverse,
music, podcasts, video, and more.
Generative AI: Today, over 10M U.S. adults begin their web search with generative AI; this will
grow to 90M by 2027, promising to reshape the largest technology businesses. Generative AI will
supercharge the productivity of consumers who use it across media, work, and other daily habits,
bringing paradigm shifts across content creation, enterprise, and search. The generative AI playing
field will not be limited to the major technology players, particularly with the rise of open-source AI
models opening the door for new, smaller entrants.
eCommerce: Global eCommerce will reach nearly $10T by 2027, growing over twice as fast as
physical retail. eCommerce is a marketplace business, with an increasing number of online retailers
launching their own marketplaces to enhance their customer value proposition and capitalize on
the retail media opportunity. eCommerce enablement solutions will continue to drive growth across
eCommerce. While Amazon continues to be the top online shopping discovery source across age
groups, TikTok is quickly emerging as one of the most popular sources among younger consumers.
B2B and Enterprise Software: By 2027, we forecast that global B2B technology spend will
reach $3.5T. This growth will be driven by industry players developing solutions to solve historically
unresolved pain points across IT processes and functional business challenges. This change is
enabled in part by AI-based innovations, including LLMs, GPU compute, and connectivity, from
major technology companies and a new generation of innovators.

14 Takeaways from the
Activate Technology & Media Outlook 2024
Gaming: With 2.6B global gamers in 2023, video gaming is one of the world’s most widespread
digital behaviors. Super Gamers, representing nearly a quarter of all U.S. gamers, have the highest
level of engagement and spend with video games and will be the most critical segment to target.
Super Gamers will also be the earliest adopters of the Metaverse, as they already take advantage
of opportunities for immersive activities within games today.
Metaverse: Today, there are over 300M active users in major virtual world platforms; we forecast
that there will be 600M people in Metaverse virtual worlds by 2026. Generative AI will accelerate
Metaverse development and investment. The major technology companies will continue to build
out their capabilities and invest across each element of the Metaverse. To capitalize on the growth
of this new frontier, all companies will need to create Metaverse strategies.
Spatial Computing: Spatial Computing will break free from the constraints of headsets as all
screens will become spatially-enabled devices — technology for people to interact with the three-
dimensional space around them. Today’s spatial technology experiences will evolve, becoming
integrated across all aspects of daily life. Apple’s entry into spatial computing will be a catalyst
for the growth of an overall developer ecosystem, while other companies will compete to create
the spatial computing operating system.
Social Video: TikTok will strengthen its position as the market leader in social video, expanding
its use cases to web search and eCommerce. TikTok accounts for the most consumer time spent
with social video, rivaling other major platforms.
Video: Streaming continues to grow at the expense of traditional television, but competition for
user time, attention, and subscriptions will intensify. To sustain growth and enhance monetization,
streaming services will place a greater emphasis on ad-supported tiers and bundling, have no
choice but to continue to spend on entertainment and sports programming, crackdown on
password sharing, and focus on international markets. As the cable bundle unwinds, we expect
a new wave of bundling from aggregators.

14 Takeaways from the
Activate Technology & Media Outlook 2024
Music and Podcasts: YouTube and TikTok are now the top discovery sources for music, while
radio (surprisingly) has shown staying power. AI will transform music discovery and consumption
from individualized music recommendations to fully personalized listening experiences. A sizable
share of music listeners will be creators, with many using AI-enabled tools. The music industry
will take strong steps to protect its artists as rogue AI clones known artists’ style, compositions,
and voices.
Sports Betting: The legalization of sports betting began five years ago and its impact on the
entire sports ecosystem will grow as more states allow sports betting and more fans place bets.
Activate forecasts that the total amount wagered in sports betting will reach $186B by 2027.
Live Entertainment and Experiences: Global consumer spend on admission to live events
and experiences exceeds $110B. Consumers will continue to attend live events and experiences
in the future as a key outlet to socialize and celebrate special occasions. In the face of increased
demand for top acts, prices are expected to continue to rise.
Technology and Media Revenues: We forecast significant growth for internet and media
revenues, with global spend increasing by nearly $400B between 2023 to 2027. Increases in
advertising will drive more than half of this growth.

14 Takeaways from the
Activate Technology & Media Outlook 2024
Consumer Time and Attention: Activate’s analysis of consumer technology and media activity
shows that multitasking leads to a nearly 32-hour day for the average American, with over 13 hours
spent using technology and media. By 2027, we project that time spend with technology and media
will increase by 12 minutes a day.
Super Users: To drive growth, the imperative for technology and media companies will be to
identify, reach, and super-serve Super Users – the segment of power users who account for a
disproportionately high share of time and spend across technology and media activities, including
AR/VR, eCommerce, gaming, generative AI, live events, messaging and social media, Metaverse,
music, podcasts, video, and more.
Generative AI: Today, over 10M U.S. adults begin their web search with generative AI; this will
grow to 90M by 2027, promising to reshape the largest technology businesses. Generative AI will
supercharge the productivity of consumers who use it across media, work, and other daily habits,
bringing paradigm shifts across content creation, enterprise, and search. The generative AI playing
field will not be limited to the major technology players, particularly with the rise of open-source AI
models opening the door for new, smaller entrants.
eCommerce: Global eCommerce will reach nearly $10T by 2027, growing over twice as fast as
physical retail. eCommerce is a marketplace business, with an increasing number of online retailers
launching their own marketplaces to enhance their customer value proposition and capitalize on
the retail media opportunity. eCommerce enablement solutions will continue to drive growth across
eCommerce. While Amazon continues to be the top online shopping discovery source across age
groups, TikTok is quickly emerging as one of the most popular sources among younger consumers.
B2B and Enterprise Software: By 2027, we forecast that global B2B technology spend will
reach $3.5T. This growth will be driven by industry players developing solutions to solve historically
unresolved pain points across IT processes and functional business challenges. This change is
enabled in part by AI-based innovations, including LLMs, GPU compute, and connectivity, from
major technology companies and a new generation of innovators.

14 Takeaways from the
Activate Technology & Media Outlook 2024
Gaming: With 2.6B global gamers in 2023, video gaming is one of the world’s most widespread
digital behaviors. Super Gamers, representing nearly a quarter of all U.S. gamers, have the highest
level of engagement and spend with video games and will be the most critical segment to target.
Super Gamers will also be the earliest adopters of the Metaverse, as they already take advantage
of opportunities for immersive activities within games today.
Metaverse: Today, there are over 300M active users in major virtual world platforms; we forecast
that there will be 600M people in Metaverse virtual worlds by 2026. Generative AI will accelerate
Metaverse development and investment. The major technology companies will continue to build
out their capabilities and invest across each element of the Metaverse. To capitalize on the growth
of this new frontier, all companies will need to create Metaverse strategies.
Spatial Computing: Spatial Computing will break free from the constraints of headsets as all
screens will become spatially-enabled devices — technology for people to interact with the three-
dimensional space around them. Today’s spatial technology experiences will evolve, becoming
integrated across all aspects of daily life. Apple’s entry into spatial computing will be a catalyst
for the growth of an overall developer ecosystem, while other companies will compete to create
the spatial computing operating system.
Social Video: TikTok will strengthen its position as the market leader in social video, expanding
its use cases to web search and eCommerce. TikTok accounts for the most consumer time spent
with social video, rivaling other major platforms.
Video: Streaming continues to grow at the expense of traditional television, but competition for
user time, attention, and subscriptions will intensify. To sustain growth and enhance monetization,
streaming services will place a greater emphasis on ad-supported tiers and bundling, have no
choice but to continue to spend on entertainment and sports programming, crackdown on
password sharing, and focus on international markets. As the cable bundle unwinds, we expect
a new wave of bundling from aggregators.

14 Takeaways from the
Activate Technology & Media Outlook 2024
Music and Podcasts: YouTube and TikTok are now the top discovery sources for music, while
radio (surprisingly) has shown staying power. AI will transform music discovery and consumption
from individualized music recommendations to fully personalized listening experiences. A sizable
share of music listeners will be creators, with many using AI-enabled tools. The music industry
will take strong steps to protect its artists as rogue AI clones known artists’ style, compositions,
and voices.
Sports Betting: The legalization of sports betting began five years ago and its impact on the
entire sports ecosystem will grow as more states allow sports betting and more fans place bets.
Activate forecasts that the total amount wagered in sports betting will reach $186B by 2027.
Live Entertainment and Experiences: Global consumer spend on admission to live events
and experiences exceeds $110B. Consumers will continue to attend live events and experiences
in the future as a key outlet to socialize and celebrate special occasions. In the face of increased
demand for top acts, prices are expected to continue to rise.
Technology and Media Revenues: We forecast significant growth for internet and media
revenues, with global spend increasing by nearly $400B between 2023 to 2027. Increases in
advertising will drive more than half of this growth.

经济回升曲折前行，势头总体向好
中国经济在 2023 年一季度实现超预期复苏，但随着前期积压需求集中释放，二季度复苏势头减
缓，之后在着力扩大内需、提振信心的一系列宏观经济政策支持下，三季度有所企稳。前三季度，
按不变价格计算，GDP同比增长5.2%。
2023 年房地产市场依旧低迷，前11个月房地产开发投资同比下降9.4%，降幅基本与上年持平，
但商品房销售面积和销售金额降幅则较上年大幅收窄。预计 2024 年房地产市场将呈现低景气稳
定，不同能级城市间的分化可能更为显著。消费市场方面，在低基数效应下，伴随一系列促消费
政策显效、失业率下降以及此前超额储蓄的积累，2023 年居民消费倾向明显改善。预计2024 年
居民收入将稳步增长，消费仍将是拉动经济增长的重要动力。
12 月中央经济工作会议指出，经济回升向好需要克服有效需求不足、社会预期偏弱等诸多困难和
挑战，但总体来看有利条件强于不利因素，同时预计2024年将推出更多利于稳预期、稳增长、稳
就业的政策，不断巩固稳中向好的基础。惠誉博华预计，2024 年中国将着力扩大国内需求，激发
有潜能的消费，培育壮大新型消费，大力发展新的消费增长点，消费市场活力将持续释放，固定
资产投资增速或现回升，出口增速有望转正，预计全年GDP同比增长4.8%。
住户部门债务组成部分此消彼长，杠杆率基本保持平稳
截至2023年三季度末，中国住户部门总债务规模约88万亿元，同比增长6.5%，增速较上年同期
进一步下行。2023 年一季度，在消费贷款余额快速增长驱动下，住户部门总债务增速出现反弹，
结束了此前连续 7 个季度的回落。此后个人住房贷款余额增速由正转负，而消费贷和经营贷虽仍
保持较高增速，但增减影响相抵后，前三季度总债务规模增速基本持平。惠誉博华测算的2023年
三季度末中国住户部门杠杆率约为 70.5%，较年初小幅上涨，但整体来看已连续三年保持平稳。
此外，相较于2022 年，2023 年居民收入增速回升、基准贷款利率下调以及住房贷款利率政策调
整，都有助于改善住户部门的偿债能力，而这一趋势有望在2024年延续。
• 住房贷款：2023年三季度末，银行个人房贷余额38.4万亿元，同比下降1.3%，增速连续两
个季度负增长。值得注意的是，2022年末个人公积金房贷余额7.3万亿元，同比增长5.9%，
系过去八年来增速首次反超银行个人房贷，显示了公积金贷款的逆向调节作用。虽然2023年
公积金贷款数据尚未披露，但预计增速仍将高于银行房贷。
• 消费贷款：2023 年非银机构发放的消费贷款余额大幅增长，占住户部门总债务比例提升近 2
个百分点，但绝对规模仍较低。由于汽车金融公司零售贷款规模并未出现明显变化，增量可
能主要来自于消费金融公司。银行发放的一般消费贷款规模保持高个位数增速，信用卡应偿
贷款规模则出现了同比负增长，预计2024年或有所改善。
• 经营贷款：2023 年三季度末，住户部门经营贷款余额 21.9 万亿元，同比增长 18.2%，快于
2022年。受政策鼓励及引导，预计2024年经营贷款规模仍将保持较快增长。

资产表现展望：稳定
2023年前8个月，RMBS基础资产逾期率指数呈小幅上涨趋势。9月受存量房贷利率调降的影响，
大量基础资产提前还款导致 RMBS 产品资产池规模大幅缩减，尽管逾期资产规模并未出现明显攀
升，但受基数效应影响，RMBS 逾期率指数陡升，然而该情况并不代表 RMBS 资产质量恶化。基
于对中国经济的持续复苏预期以及房屋价值对存量基础资产的保障，惠誉博华预计2024年RMBS
基础资产的信用表现将保持稳定。
存量房贷基本完成利率下调，未对RMBS超额利差产生实质负面影响
2023 年中国人民银行持续完善市场化利率形成和传导机制，推动房贷利率下行。8 月 31 日，中
国人民银行、金融监管总局发布《关于降低存量首套房贷利率有关事项的通知》。中国人民银行
数据显示，截至 9 月末，近 6 成存量房贷完成利率下调，调整后的加权平均利率为 4.27%，平均
降幅约73 个基点。2023 年9 月，新发放个人住房贷款加权平均利率 4.02%，同比下降32 个基
点。综合来看，9月末已完成下调的存量房贷利率与当月新增房贷利率的差距收窄至25个基点，
房贷利率政策调整已相继带动新发放房贷利率和存量房贷利率显著下降，降幅超过同期LPR。
在 RMBS 超额利差方面，RMBS 基础资产平均利率水平有所降低，9 月末的资产池加权平均利率
为4.12%，较8月末下降25个基点，降幅小于房贷市场的平均水平。另一方面，本轮房贷借款人
集中提前还款带来的资产池利息回收款显著增多，以及优先级证券余额衰减使得利息支出减少，
导致RMBS超额利差水平在9月显著升高，存量房贷利率调降未对RMBS产品的超额利差水平产
生实质性的负面影响。由于大部分 RMBS 交易次级证券不存在期间收益，随着优先级证券的兑付，
证券端的加权平均利率水平将继续下降，预计后续超额利差仍将保持动态上行态势。此外，
RMBS产品优先级证券的加速兑付使得2023年10月尚未清偿的优先级证券余额环比缩减超50%，
当前余额占初始发行金额的比例骤降至17.7%。
住宅价格呈下行趋势，预计将持续承压，但RMBS底层担保水平充足
2023 年，住宅价格于年初有所回升，后呈持续下跌趋势。其中，一线城市二手住宅价格波动较大，
11月，一线城市二手住宅销售价格环比下降1.4%，降幅比上月扩大0.6个百分点，与一线城市新
建商品住宅降幅的差距扩大至 1.1 个百分点。为维护房地产市场平稳健康发展，广州、深圳、北
京和上海先后于 11 月和12 月发布了调整优化房地产相关政策，涉及调整普通住房标准、降低购
房首付比例、降低房贷利率等，旨在降低购房者房贷首付和月供支出，减轻购房压力，给予市场
更多信心。然而当前房地产市场仍处于调整周期，预计2024年住宅价格仍将持续承压。
虽然住宅价格整体处于下行通道，但鉴于 RMBS 产品初始贷款价值比较高，且基础资产账龄较初
始起算日已显著增加，抵押房产价格对 RMBS 基础资产的担保水平仍然较为充足。综合来看，惠
誉博华认为RMBS产品优先级证券获得的信用支持未受到负面影响。

2023年银行间市场车贷ABS基础资产逾期指数走势平稳，逾期率保持在较低水平。2023年，国
内乘用车市场竞争越发激烈，汽车生产厂商以及关联汽车金融公司在市场份额方面有所变化，但
由于车贷 ABS 的入池资产合格标准基本保持稳定，汽车贷款借款人的信用质量并未发生明显变化，
惠誉博华预计2024年车贷ABS基础资产的信用表现将保持稳定。
乘用车销售超预期，新能源乘用车渗透率节节提升
2023 年中国乘用车新车销售2,162 万辆1，同比增长5.2%，明显好于市场预期。全年来看，除一
月、六月和七月外，其他各月销量均同比高于上年。作为家庭大宗消费品，在当前大力促进国内
消费，增加经济增长动能的背景下，汽车行业更是政府重点扶持对象。中国乘用车市场已连续三
年实现增长，主要得益于新能源汽车的蓬勃发展。2023 年，国内新能源乘用车全年销售 774 万
辆，同比增长 36.7%，增速虽较上年有大幅度回落，但依然保持了很高水平；与此同时，新能源
乘用车全年渗透率达到 35.8%，较上年提高 8 个百分点，渗透率于年内呈现出逐月走高趋势，最
后两个月均超过40%。
新能源乘用车销量及渗透率的同步提升，带动银行间市场信贷资产证券化中的绿色车贷 ABS 比例
提升。2023 年，绿色车贷ABS 发行数量和规模均较上年有良好增长，在车贷ABS 发行整体萎缩
的情况下，绿色车贷ABS发行表现尤为突出，其2023年占比为24%，较上年上升10个百分点。
绿色车贷 ABS 基础资产的逾期表现与整体没有明显差异，并且随着新能源汽车渗透率的提高，预
计绿色与非绿色车贷的客群和贷款特征将趋同，因此惠誉博华认为银行间市场车贷 ABS 绿色属性
的加重，并不会给车贷 ABS 整体资产表现带来负面影响。另一方面，为了促进新能源汽车发展，
监管政策许可新能源汽车贷款适用更低的首付要求，若未来一部分贷款发放机构对新能源汽车贷
款普遍适用更加宽松的贷款标准，则车贷资产表现将可能出现分化。
车贷ABS基础资产中的自主品牌比例升高
近年来，以新能源为引领，中国自主品牌乘用车的国内市场占有率呈上升趋势。依据乘联会口径，
2019 年至2021 年中期，自主品牌乘用车的月度销售市场占有率几乎都在 40%以下，2021 年下
半年以来，随着新能源汽车渗透率的上升，自主品牌的市场份额上升势头迅猛。2023 年 10 月，
自主品牌的单月市场占有率达到55.5%，前十个月的累计占有率为51.3%，高于2022年全年4个
百分点。伴随自主品牌乘用车市场份额的增长，银行间市场车贷 ABS 存量资产中来自于主要服务
自主品牌的汽车金融公司的基础资产比例同步升高，其 2021 年和 2022 年的均值分别为 23%和
25%，2023 年前十个月平均为 32%，当前银行间市场车贷 ABS 基础资产处于历史以来自主品牌
含量最高的时期，并且预计未来可能继续升高。

经济回升曲折前行，势头总体向好
中国经济在 2023 年一季度实现超预期复苏，但随着前期积压需求集中释放，二季度复苏势头减
缓，之后在着力扩大内需、提振信心的一系列宏观经济政策支持下，三季度有所企稳。前三季度，
按不变价格计算，GDP同比增长5.2%。
2023 年房地产市场依旧低迷，前11个月房地产开发投资同比下降9.4%，降幅基本与上年持平，
但商品房销售面积和销售金额降幅则较上年大幅收窄。预计 2024 年房地产市场将呈现低景气稳
定，不同能级城市间的分化可能更为显著。消费市场方面，在低基数效应下，伴随一系列促消费
政策显效、失业率下降以及此前超额储蓄的积累，2023 年居民消费倾向明显改善。预计2024 年
居民收入将稳步增长，消费仍将是拉动经济增长的重要动力。
12 月中央经济工作会议指出，经济回升向好需要克服有效需求不足、社会预期偏弱等诸多困难和
挑战，但总体来看有利条件强于不利因素，同时预计2024年将推出更多利于稳预期、稳增长、稳
就业的政策，不断巩固稳中向好的基础。惠誉博华预计，2024 年中国将着力扩大国内需求，激发
有潜能的消费，培育壮大新型消费，大力发展新的消费增长点，消费市场活力将持续释放，固定
资产投资增速或现回升，出口增速有望转正，预计全年GDP同比增长4.8%。
住户部门债务组成部分此消彼长，杠杆率基本保持平稳
截至2023年三季度末，中国住户部门总债务规模约88万亿元，同比增长6.5%，增速较上年同期
进一步下行。2023 年一季度，在消费贷款余额快速增长驱动下，住户部门总债务增速出现反弹，
结束了此前连续 7 个季度的回落。此后个人住房贷款余额增速由正转负，而消费贷和经营贷虽仍
保持较高增速，但增减影响相抵后，前三季度总债务规模增速基本持平。惠誉博华测算的2023年
三季度末中国住户部门杠杆率约为 70.5%，较年初小幅上涨，但整体来看已连续三年保持平稳。
此外，相较于2022 年，2023 年居民收入增速回升、基准贷款利率下调以及住房贷款利率政策调
整，都有助于改善住户部门的偿债能力，而这一趋势有望在2024年延续。
• 住房贷款：2023年三季度末，银行个人房贷余额38.4万亿元，同比下降1.3%，增速连续两
个季度负增长。值得注意的是，2022年末个人公积金房贷余额7.3万亿元，同比增长5.9%，
系过去八年来增速首次反超银行个人房贷，显示了公积金贷款的逆向调节作用。虽然2023年
公积金贷款数据尚未披露，但预计增速仍将高于银行房贷。
• 消费贷款：2023 年非银机构发放的消费贷款余额大幅增长，占住户部门总债务比例提升近 2
个百分点，但绝对规模仍较低。由于汽车金融公司零售贷款规模并未出现明显变化，增量可
能主要来自于消费金融公司。银行发放的一般消费贷款规模保持高个位数增速，信用卡应偿
贷款规模则出现了同比负增长，预计2024年或有所改善。
• 经营贷款：2023 年三季度末，住户部门经营贷款余额 21.9 万亿元，同比增长 18.2%，快于
2022年。受政策鼓励及引导，预计2024年经营贷款规模仍将保持较快增长。

资产表现展望：稳定
2023年前8个月，RMBS基础资产逾期率指数呈小幅上涨趋势。9月受存量房贷利率调降的影响，
大量基础资产提前还款导致 RMBS 产品资产池规模大幅缩减，尽管逾期资产规模并未出现明显攀
升，但受基数效应影响，RMBS 逾期率指数陡升，然而该情况并不代表 RMBS 资产质量恶化。基
于对中国经济的持续复苏预期以及房屋价值对存量基础资产的保障，惠誉博华预计2024年RMBS
基础资产的信用表现将保持稳定。
存量房贷基本完成利率下调，未对RMBS超额利差产生实质负面影响
2023 年中国人民银行持续完善市场化利率形成和传导机制，推动房贷利率下行。8 月 31 日，中
国人民银行、金融监管总局发布《关于降低存量首套房贷利率有关事项的通知》。中国人民银行
数据显示，截至 9 月末，近 6 成存量房贷完成利率下调，调整后的加权平均利率为 4.27%，平均
降幅约73 个基点。2023 年9 月，新发放个人住房贷款加权平均利率 4.02%，同比下降32 个基
点。综合来看，9月末已完成下调的存量房贷利率与当月新增房贷利率的差距收窄至25个基点，
房贷利率政策调整已相继带动新发放房贷利率和存量房贷利率显著下降，降幅超过同期LPR。
在 RMBS 超额利差方面，RMBS 基础资产平均利率水平有所降低，9 月末的资产池加权平均利率
为4.12%，较8月末下降25个基点，降幅小于房贷市场的平均水平。另一方面，本轮房贷借款人
集中提前还款带来的资产池利息回收款显著增多，以及优先级证券余额衰减使得利息支出减少，
导致RMBS超额利差水平在9月显著升高，存量房贷利率调降未对RMBS产品的超额利差水平产
生实质性的负面影响。由于大部分 RMBS 交易次级证券不存在期间收益，随着优先级证券的兑付，
证券端的加权平均利率水平将继续下降，预计后续超额利差仍将保持动态上行态势。此外，
RMBS产品优先级证券的加速兑付使得2023年10月尚未清偿的优先级证券余额环比缩减超50%，
当前余额占初始发行金额的比例骤降至17.7%。
住宅价格呈下行趋势，预计将持续承压，但RMBS底层担保水平充足
2023 年，住宅价格于年初有所回升，后呈持续下跌趋势。其中，一线城市二手住宅价格波动较大，
11月，一线城市二手住宅销售价格环比下降1.4%，降幅比上月扩大0.6个百分点，与一线城市新
建商品住宅降幅的差距扩大至 1.1 个百分点。为维护房地产市场平稳健康发展，广州、深圳、北
京和上海先后于 11 月和12 月发布了调整优化房地产相关政策，涉及调整普通住房标准、降低购
房首付比例、降低房贷利率等，旨在降低购房者房贷首付和月供支出，减轻购房压力，给予市场
更多信心。然而当前房地产市场仍处于调整周期，预计2024年住宅价格仍将持续承压。
虽然住宅价格整体处于下行通道，但鉴于 RMBS 产品初始贷款价值比较高，且基础资产账龄较初
始起算日已显著增加，抵押房产价格对 RMBS 基础资产的担保水平仍然较为充足。综合来看，惠
誉博华认为RMBS产品优先级证券获得的信用支持未受到负面影响。

资产表现展望：稳定
2023年银行间市场车贷ABS基础资产逾期指数走势平稳，逾期率保持在较低水平。2023年，国
内乘用车市场竞争越发激烈，汽车生产厂商以及关联汽车金融公司在市场份额方面有所变化，但
由于车贷 ABS 的入池资产合格标准基本保持稳定，汽车贷款借款人的信用质量并未发生明显变化，
惠誉博华预计2024年车贷ABS基础资产的信用表现将保持稳定。
乘用车销售超预期，新能源乘用车渗透率节节提升
2023 年中国乘用车新车销售2,162 万辆1，同比增长5.2%，明显好于市场预期。全年来看，除一
月、六月和七月外，其他各月销量均同比高于上年。作为家庭大宗消费品，在当前大力促进国内
消费，增加经济增长动能的背景下，汽车行业更是政府重点扶持对象。中国乘用车市场已连续三
年实现增长，主要得益于新能源汽车的蓬勃发展。2023 年，国内新能源乘用车全年销售 774 万
辆，同比增长 36.7%，增速虽较上年有大幅度回落，但依然保持了很高水平；与此同时，新能源
乘用车全年渗透率达到 35.8%，较上年提高 8 个百分点，渗透率于年内呈现出逐月走高趋势，最
后两个月均超过40%。
新能源乘用车销量及渗透率的同步提升，带动银行间市场信贷资产证券化中的绿色车贷 ABS 比例
提升。2023 年，绿色车贷ABS 发行数量和规模均较上年有良好增长，在车贷ABS 发行整体萎缩
的情况下，绿色车贷ABS发行表现尤为突出，其2023年占比为24%，较上年上升10个百分点。
绿色车贷 ABS 基础资产的逾期表现与整体没有明显差异，并且随着新能源汽车渗透率的提高，预
计绿色与非绿色车贷的客群和贷款特征将趋同，因此惠誉博华认为银行间市场车贷 ABS 绿色属性
的加重，并不会给车贷 ABS 整体资产表现带来负面影响。另一方面，为了促进新能源汽车发展，
监管政策许可新能源汽车贷款适用更低的首付要求，若未来一部分贷款发放机构对新能源汽车贷
款普遍适用更加宽松的贷款标准，则车贷资产表现将可能出现分化。
车贷ABS基础资产中的自主品牌比例升高
近年来，以新能源为引领，中国自主品牌乘用车的国内市场占有率呈上升趋势。依据乘联会口径，
2019 年至2021 年中期，自主品牌乘用车的月度销售市场占有率几乎都在 40%以下，2021 年下
半年以来，随着新能源汽车渗透率的上升，自主品牌的市场份额上升势头迅猛。2023 年 10 月，
自主品牌的单月市场占有率达到55.5%，前十个月的累计占有率为51.3%，高于2022年全年4个
百分点。伴随自主品牌乘用车市场份额的增长，银行间市场车贷 ABS 存量资产中来自于主要服务
自主品牌的汽车金融公司的基础资产比例同步升高，其 2021 年和 2022 年的均值分别为 23%和
25%，2023 年前十个月平均为 32%，当前银行间市场车贷 ABS 基础资产处于历史以来自主品牌
含量最高的时期，并且预计未来可能继续升高。

从本周的数据来看，抖音平台上的服饰电商行业整体表现出一定的下滑趋势。销售
额和销量指数分别下降了29.72%和31.29%，这可能是由于市场竞争激烈，或者消
费者购买力的下降。总体来说，尽管短期内抖音平台的服饰电商行业表现出下滑的
趋势，但长期来看，其发展潜力依然值得期待。

从本周的数据来看，抖音平台上的服饰电商行业整体表现出一定的下滑趋势。销售
额和销量指数分别下降了29.72%和31.29%，这可能是由于市场竞争激烈，或者消
费者购买力的下降。总体来说，尽管短期内抖音平台的服饰电商行业表现出下滑的
趋势，但长期来看，其发展潜力依然值得期待。

摘要
随着移动物联网终端数量高速增长，如视频监控、工业传感
器、可穿戴设备等典型物联网业务的市场规模潜力巨大。以可穿
戴设备为例，预计 2023 年国内终端出货量超 1600 万，2025 年全
球终端数量超过 8000 万，具备千万级市场潜力，而传感器的规

性要求高，成本功耗敏感的需求智，3GPP 立项了基于 NR 新空口的
库
低能力 NR 终端（Reduced Capability NR Devices，RedCap 终
端）课题，R17 和 R18 两个版本的 RedCap 标准设计通过降低 5G
终端的能力实现终端成本降低，满足速率需求的同时通过技术手
段保证 RedCap 终端与传统终端共存，通过早期识别和接入控制
保证网络对不同能力的终端可管可控，未来将大大扩展 5G 的生
态系统，提升 5G 在物联领域的竞争力。
一、 R17 RedCap
1
R17 RedCap 定义了面向物联网的第一款 5G NR 终端类型，其
面向的是较高端的、与 LTE Cat4 性能可比的物联网用例。R17
RedCap 终端成本降低的设计主要包括以下方面：
1）带宽降低：标准支持 RedCap 终端在 FR1 和 FR2 的带宽能力分
别从 100MHz 和 200MHz 降低为 20MHz 和 100MHz，成本降低主要来
源于基带的模数/数模转换器、FFT/IFFT 模块和数据缓存模块。
中
在满足速率要求的同时，不需要为 RedCap 终端进行新的初始接
移
入流程设计，复用 5G 初始接入流程，从而避免市场分化。
智
2）接收天线数和下行 MIMO 流数降低：RedCap 终端最小接收天线
库
数从 FDD 2Rx、TDD 4Rx 降低为 1Rx 和 2Rx，成本降低主要来源于
射频滤波器和收发机模块。综合智能可穿戴设备的产业现状和网
络覆盖性能，接收天线数的选择保证了 RedCap 终端的弹性市场
空间。
3）最大调制阶数放松：下行最大调制阶数从 256QAM 放松为
64QAM，成本降低主要来源于射频收发机和基带的模数/数模转换
器。上行最大调制阶数不进行放松，一方面由于调制阶数降低带
2
来的成本降低有限，另一方面考虑 RedCap 的应用场景中上行业
务较多，避免影响业务体验。
4）半双工 FDD：半双工 FDD 指将终端的双工器替换为开关和滤波
器，以半双工方式在 FDD 不同收发频段之间转换，不能同时接收
信号和发送信号。该能力为可选能力，如果未上报该能力，在
FDD 频段仍采用全双工 FDD。
中
5）最大数据无线承载 DRB 数量降低：支持多个 DRB 一般针对终
移
端有多个业务场景、业务类型的情况，考虑到 RedCap 适用场景
智
相对有限，标准将 RedCap 终端支持的最大 DRB 数从 16 个降低为
库
8 个，实现终端芯片缓存容量和内存设计的成本开销降低。
6）序列号 SN 长度降低：SN 用于对 PDCP/RLC 服务数据单元进行
编号，并确定重排序或发送/接收窗口的数值，其长度反映缓冲
区大小的能力。考虑到 RedCap 终端所需的峰值数据速率较低，
对 PDCP 的 SN 长度和 RLC 工作在 AM 模式下的 SN 长度从 18 比特减
小为 12 比特。
3
上述带宽降低、接收天线数和 MIMO 流数降低、最大调制阶
数放松、半双工技术等复杂度降低手段相结合可降低约 60%的 5G
终端通信模块成本[1]。
终端节能方面，考虑到物联网终端设备对电池使用寿命更加
敏感，标准化针对新的终端形态引入了进一步降低终端能耗的技
术特性，包括 eDRX 和 RRM 测量放松。
中
1）eDRX
移
eDRX 通过为 RedCap 终端配置较长的 DRX 周期，减少终端在
智
空闲和非激活态下监听寻呼带来的功耗。CN eDRX 周期扩展为
库
2.56s~10485.76s，RAN eDRX 周期扩展为 2.56s~10.24s。当 eDRX
周期小于 10.24s，eDRX 周期作为寻呼周期。当 eDRX 周期大于
10.24s，终端首先根据公式确定其需要侦听的寻呼超帧 PH，并确
定 PH 中具体监听的寻呼时间窗 PTW，在 PTW 内基于现有 DRX 机制
确定寻呼时机位置。
2）RRM 测量放松
4
RRM 测量放松通过设计邻区的测量放松机制，在保证业务连
续性的同时减少不必要的终端测量功耗。测量放松基本流程是，
终端评估是否满足网络广播的放松准则，在满足放松准则的情况
下，采用协议定义的放松的测量指标进行测量。

R17 RedCap 终端设计需要在降低 5G 终端的复杂度及成本，
满足速率需求的同时，实现与非 RedCap 终端的共存部署，避免

计主要包括以下方面：
智
1）RedCap 专属初始 BWP：考虑到传统终端的初始上行 BWP 带宽
库
可以超过 20MHz，如果 RedCap 带宽降低且复用传统终端的初始上
行 BWP，将导致一系列的共存问题，包括 RACH、Msg3、PUCCH 等
传输超过 RedCap 最大带宽，以及网络接入容量受限问题。标准
支持为 RedCap 配置专属初始 BWP，保证 RedCap 终端工作带宽不
大于其支持的带宽能力。基于专属初始 BWP 架构解决共存问题相
比于其他候选方案对基站调度复杂度影响较小，同时还利于实现
针对 RedCap 终端容量的灵活扩展、网络负载分流和匹配调度。
6
2）去使能 PUCCH 时隙内跳频：在与传统终端共存的情况下，如
果 RedCap 终端在其初始 BWP 内使用跳频方式传输 PUCCH，PUCCH
位于其初始 BWP 的两端，导致整个上行带宽被分割成非连续带
宽，影响支持单载波传输的传统终端的上行峰值速率。网络可以
通过去使能 RedCap 专属初始上行 BWP 的 PUCCH 时隙内跳频，避免
造成传统终端 PUSCH 资源的碎片化，减少对传统终端的性能影
响。 中

3）半双工 FDD 上下行冲突处理机制：当半双工 FDD 和全双工 FDD
智
终端共存时，基站可能仍按照全双工 FDD 终端调度上行和下行传
库
输，而半双工 FDD 终端无法在同一个符号上的两个频带同时进行
上行发射和下行接收。标准引入针对半双工 FDD 终端的上下行冲
突处理机制，明确半双工 FDD 终端如何进行上行发射和下行接收
的选择。
为了网络对不同类型终端具备灵活的控制管理权，标准支持
RedCap 终端的早期识别和接入控制，实现网络匹配调度，根据网
络资源和负载情况调整终端接入，避免 RedCap 终端过度占用网
络资源，降低对传统终端性能影响。
7
1）早期识别
RedCap 终端的早期识别主要借助随机接入过程实现，识别后网络
可以在 RedCap 终端接入过程中针对其能力执行特定的调度决策
或者服务。另一方面，早期识别可以减少终端不必要的接入尝
试，有利于终端能耗降低。基于 Msg1/MsgA 的提前识别是网络可

2）接入控制
库
为了支持针对特定终端的灵活接入控制，网络通过系统信息分别
指示 1Rx 和 2Rx RedCap 终端是否允许接入当前小区，同时对终
端小区选择、小区重选参数及对应行为进行了详细定义，便于网
络更好地服务终端。
二、 R18 eRedCap
在 R17 RedCap 应用场景的基础上，R18 eRedCap 旨在进一步
扩展 RedCap 生态，面向更低成本，更低能耗，更低数据速率
8
（10Mbps）要求，介于 LPWA 和 R17 RedCap 能力之间的物联网用
例，例如工业无线传感网络，智能电网等。
R18 eRedCap 主要的成本降低手段是保持射频带宽 20MHz，
数据信道基带降低为 5MHz，峰值速率降低为 10Mbps，相比 R17
RedCap 可降低约 12%的终端通信模块成本[2]。
由于基带带宽降低的 R18 eRedCap 需要较大的标准改动，具
中
有一定部署和实施复杂度，标准同时支持了 R18 eRedCap 的第二
移
种成本降低手段：峰值速率降低作为独立特征。峰值速率降低只
智
需对协议现有能力参数进行扩展，基站调度简单灵活，与 R17
库
RedCap 终端能够共存并共享早期识别资源和初始接入流程，易于
实现 R17 RedCap 网络中 R18 eRedCap 终端的快速部署。另外，
峰 值 速 率降 低 独 立特 征 的 引入 使 R18 eRedCap 终 端和 LTE
Cat1bis 终端具有相同的 20MHz 带宽和可比的峰值速率，两者能
够共享大部分基带模块，具有相近的复杂度，使得在 LTE
Cat1bis 终端上实现 R18 eRedCap 的功能，开发双模终端易于实
现。

终端节能方面，为了进一步降低终端能耗，R18 eRedCap 节
能增强技术主要就 R17 版本未定义的非激活态下 RAN eDRX 周期
超过 10.24s 时的寻呼监听机制进行了讨论。R18 版本将非激活态
RAN eDRX 周期最大值扩展为 10485.76s，定义了非激活态下 CN
和 RAN eDRX 周期同时超过 10.24s 时，通过 CN 和 RAN 的寻呼超帧
PH 和寻呼时间窗 PTW 确定寻呼时机的监听机制，规定了根据 CN
和 RAN 的 PTW 位置确定中寻呼周期 T 的规则。R18 版本还规定了

基带带宽降低的情况下，需要网络引入一系列的调度限制以
实 现 R18 eRedCap 与 传 统 终 端 的 共 存 ， 例 如 调 度 限 制
MsgA、Msg3、Msg4 小于 5MHz，而系统消息、寻呼 PDSCH、RAR、
广播 MBS 等广播消息仍可以大于 5MHz，具体包括以下方面：
1）标准针对基带带宽降低的 R18 eRedCap 终端，考虑了随机接
入响应 RAR 的处理时间放松。在未配置针对 R18 eRedCap 的早期
中
识别的情况下，基站发送的 RAR 无法区分 R18 eRedCap 与 R17
移
RedCap 终端，因此 RAR 带宽可能大于 5MHz。当 RAR 带宽大于
智
5MHz 时，R18 eRedCap 基带处理时间将比传统终端增加 X。如果
库
X 取值过大，网络按照 R18 eRedCap 能力调度 Msg3 时可用时域资
源分配值较少，调度限制严重，并且会大大增加传统终端的接入
时延。综合考虑调度 Msg3 灵活性和降低接入时延，标准放松 RAR
处理时间为现有处理时间加上 1 个时隙。如果网络调度 RAR 和
Msg3 之间的时间间隔小于处理时间，R18 eRedCap 终端行为取决
于实现，处理能力强的终端仍可以发送 Msg3。
2）标准针对两种物理信道并发时超过 R18 eRedCap 终端带宽能
力的场景进行了接收规则设计。R18 eRedCap 与传统终端共享广
11
播消息，如果 R18 eRedCap 同时接收的单播、广播信道总带宽大
于 5MHz，终端无法同时处理，需要规定处理顺序保证高优先级的
信道被解调：
a.对于系统消息、寻呼、RAR 等 2 个广播信道的同时接收，由于
系统消息和寻呼没有处理时序要求，可以缓存后处理，不会影响
网络同时为传统终端调度 2 个广播信道。
中
b.对于单播与自动系统消息的同时接收，单播可能有 HARQ 反馈
移
时序要求，标准规定优先解调单播。
智
c.对于连接态 P-RNTI 触发的系统消息和单播同时接收，P-RNTI
库
触发的系统消息接收通常用于传输短消息或系统消息更新，优先
级比单播更高，终端可以跳过单播解调。
d.对于 RAR 和单播同时接收，随机接入有更高优先级，终端优先
处理 RAR。
为了保证网络对 R18 eRedCap 终端可管可控，标准支持 R18
eRedCap 终端的早期识别和接入控制，实现网络匹配调度，避免
R18 eRedCap RAR 处理时间放松影响传统终端的接入时延。
12
1）早期识别
针对四步接入，基于 Msg1 的识别网络可配，如果不配置，R18
eRedCap 可复用 R17 RedCap Msg1 识别的资源，减轻随机接入资
源碎片化问题，同时标准也支持基于 Msg3 的识别。针对两步接

可以配置专属 MsgA PUSCH 资源识别 R18 eRedCap。

三、 结语
R17 和 R18 RedCap 终端将大幅降低 5G 终端模组成本，补齐
5G 中高速率拼图，扩展 5G 生态系统，推动 5G 在更多行业的落
地。此外，RedCap 技术在确保物联网业务需求的前提下，还能通
过 eDRX 周期下定位增强、参考信号跳频设计等兼顾定位、NTN 等
场景需求，形成全场景 5G 移动物联网技术体系，实现移动物联

可以在 RedCap 终端接入过程中针对其能力执行特定的调度决策
或者服务。另一方面，早期识别可以减少终端不必要的接入尝
试，有利于终端能耗降低。基于 Msg1/MsgA 的提前识别是网络可
配的，终端通过检查网络是否配置了相应的资源确定是否可以使

2）接入控制
库
为了支持针对特定终端的灵活接入控制，网络通过系统信息分别
指示 1Rx 和 2Rx RedCap 终端是否允许接入当前小区，同时对终
端小区选择、小区重选参数及对应行为进行了详细定义，便于网
络更好地服务终端。
二、 R18 eRedCap
在 R17 RedCap 应用场景的基础上，R18 eRedCap 旨在进一步
扩展 RedCap 生态，面向更低成本，更低能耗，更低数据速率
8
（10Mbps）要求，介于 LPWA 和 R17 RedCap 能力之间的物联网用
例，例如工业无线传感网络，智能电网等。
R18 eRedCap 主要的成本降低手段是保持射频带宽 20MHz，
数据信道基带降低为 5MHz，峰值速率降低为 10Mbps，相比 R17
RedCap 可降低约 12%的终端通信模块成本[2]。
由于基带带宽降低的 R18 eRedCap 需要较大的标准改动，具
中
有一定部署和实施复杂度，标准同时支持了 R18 eRedCap 的第二

种成本降低手段：峰值速率降低作为独立特征。峰值速率降低只

需对协议现有能力参数进行扩展，基站调度简单灵活，与 R17
库
RedCap 终端能够共存并共享早期识别资源和初始接入流程，易于
实现 R17 RedCap 网络中 R18 eRedCap 终端的快速部署。另外，
峰 值 速 率降 低 独 立特 征 的 引入 使 R18 eRedCap 终 端和 LTE
Cat1bis 终端具有相同的 20MHz 带宽和可比的峰值速率，两者能
够共享大部分基带模块，具有相近的复杂度，使得在 LTE
Cat1bis 终端上实现 R18 eRedCap 的功能，开发双模终端易于实
现。

终端节能方面，为了进一步降低终端能耗，R18 eRedCap 节
能增强技术主要就 R17 版本未定义的非激活态下 RAN eDRX 周期
超过 10.24s 时的寻呼监听机制进行了讨论。R18 版本将非激活态
RAN eDRX 周期最大值扩展为 10485.76s，定义了非激活态下 CN
和 RAN eDRX 周期同时超过 10.24s 时，通过 CN 和 RAN 的寻呼超帧
PH 和寻呼时间窗 PTW 确定寻呼时机的监听机制，规定了根据 CN
和 RAN 的 PTW 位置确定中寻呼周期 T 的规则。R18 版本还规定了

基带带宽降低的情况下，需要网络引入一系列的调度限制以
实 现 R18 eRedCap 与 传 统 终 端 的 共 存 ， 例 如 调 度 限 制
MsgA、Msg3、Msg4 小于 5MHz，而系统消息、寻呼 PDSCH、RAR、
广播 MBS 等广播消息仍可以大于 5MHz，具体包括以下方面：
1）标准针对基带带宽降低的 R18 eRedCap 终端，考虑了随机接
入响应 RAR 的处理时间放松。在未配置针对 R18 eRedCap 的早期
中
识别的情况下，基站发送的 RAR 无法区分 R18 eRedCap 与 R17
移
RedCap 终端，因此 RAR 带宽可能大于 5MHz。当 RAR 带宽大于
智
5MHz 时，R18 eRedCap 基带处理时间将比传统终端增加 X。如果
库
X 取值过大，网络按照 R18 eRedCap 能力调度 Msg3 时可用时域资
源分配值较少，调度限制严重，并且会大大增加传统终端的接入
时延。综合考虑调度 Msg3 灵活性和降低接入时延，标准放松 RAR
处理时间为现有处理时间加上 1 个时隙。如果网络调度 RAR 和
Msg3 之间的时间间隔小于处理时间，R18 eRedCap 终端行为取决
于实现，处理能力强的终端仍可以发送 Msg3。
2）标准针对两种物理信道并发时超过 R18 eRedCap 终端带宽能
力的场景进行了接收规则设计。R18 eRedCap 与传统终端共享广
11
播消息，如果 R18 eRedCap 同时接收的单播、广播信道总带宽大
于 5MHz，终端无法同时处理，需要规定处理顺序保证高优先级的
信道被解调：
a.对于系统消息、寻呼、RAR 等 2 个广播信道的同时接收，由于
系统消息和寻呼没有处理时序要求，可以缓存后处理，不会影响
网络同时为传统终端调度 2 个广播信道。
中
b.对于单播与自动系统消息的同时接收，单播可能有 HARQ 反馈
移
时序要求，标准规定优先解调单播。
智
c.对于连接态 P-RNTI 触发的系统消息和单播同时接收，P-RNTI
库
触发的系统消息接收通常用于传输短消息或系统消息更新，优先
级比单播更高，终端可以跳过单播解调。
d.对于 RAR 和单播同时接收，随机接入有更高优先级，终端优先
处理 RAR。
为了保证网络对 R18 eRedCap 终端可管可控，标准支持 R18
eRedCap 终端的早期识别和接入控制，实现网络匹配调度，避免
R18 eRedCap RAR 处理时间放松影响传统终端的接入时延。
12
1）早期识别
针对四步接入，基于 Msg1 的识别网络可配，如果不配置，R18
eRedCap 可复用 R17 RedCap Msg1 识别的资源，减轻随机接入资
源碎片化问题，同时标准也支持基于 Msg3 的识别。针对两步接
入，R18 eRedCap 共享 R17 RedCap MsgA PRACH 识别资源，网络
可以配置专属 MsgA PUSCH 资源识别 R18 eRedCap。

2）接入控制

三、 结语
R17 和 R18 RedCap 终端将大幅降低 5G 终端模组成本，补齐
5G 中高速率拼图，扩展 5G 生态系统，推动 5G 在更多行业的落
地。此外，RedCap 技术在确保物联网业务需求的前提下，还能通
过 eDRX 周期下定位增强、参考信号跳频设计等兼顾定位、NTN 等
场景需求，形成全场景 5G 移动物联网技术体系，实现移动物联

一、2023 年度股市运行回顾
（一）全球主要股市上涨，A 股主要指数继续调整
2023 年全球主要股指均呈现不同程度上涨，A 股表现欠佳。我国主要股指
跌幅差别较大，其中，上证综合指数下跌3.70%，沪深300指数下跌11.38%，深
证成份股指数下跌13.54%，创业板指数下跌19.41%；香港恒生指数下跌13.82%。
同期，美国道琼斯指数上涨13.70%，纳斯达克指数上涨43.42%（见图1）。

美国纳斯达克指数领跑全球。主导美股年度表现的是以苹果、微软、谷歌等
为代表的龙头科技公司，这些公司年度涨幅基本都在 50%左右，其中，英伟达
（NVIDIA）上涨幅度超过200%。而这些龙头科技公司股价大幅上涨，主要原因
是2023年年初以“ChatGPT”为首的人工智能技术的横空出世。
高科技股的追捧热潮在A股市场也有所表现。从行业指数看，2023年A 股
涨幅最大的行业分别是通信、传媒、煤炭、电子、计算机、家用电器、汽车（见
图 2）。通信、传媒、电子、计算机行业指数的表现与人工智能技术突破有关。
2023年度上涨幅度最大的20只股票几乎全部为“人工智能”概念股票，如此极
端的走势十分少见，似乎也预示着该板块的风险正在来临。

美容护理、商贸零售、电力设备、房地产等行业则全年领跌。在 2023 年度
下跌幅度最大的 20 只股票中，新能源行业股票占据半壁江山。过去几年，中国
在新能源电池和新能源汽车行业取得了局部领先的优势，相关上市公司的业绩表
现优异，众多资金跟风推高了这些公司的估值。宁德时代和比亚迪等新能源电池
和新能源汽车行业的代表，股票价格在2020年之后大幅度上涨（见图3），而2023
年该板块的股票均出现较大幅度的回落，有些股票下跌幅度已超过50%。

（二）美联储快速加息对股市冲击巨大
美联储不断超预期的加息对中国股市产生了巨大影响。2023 年第四季度，
美国 10 年期国债到期收益率最高上升至 5%左右，我国 10 年期国债到期收益率
基本徘徊在2.7%左右，比美国10年期国债到期收益率低200余个基点。中美国
债到期收益率倒挂导致我国资金外流。可以直接观察到的现象是，每当美国 10
年期国债到期收益率上升，则美元走强，“北向资金”流出、人民币兑美元汇率
贬值，结果是A股走弱。2023年8月至2023年末，陆港通渠道资金一直是净流
出状态。其中，8月净流出896.83亿元，创两年来单月净流出记录（见表3）。

外资的流出并没有影响内资的加杠杆行为。2023 年，融资余额增加了 1300
亿元。在股指持续下跌的背景下，融资余额却不断增加，出现逆势加杠杆现象。
外资与内资截然相反的行为在A股历史上应该是第一次出现。

（三）房地产行业处于深度调整中，相关产业链的股票表现均受到影响
2023 年一季度，房地产市场出现逐月回升的“小阳春”，但是从 4 月以后，
房地产市场的交易量出现疲态。7月底的中央政治局会议明确提出“房地产市场
供求关系发生重大变化”，市场普遍认为这是房地产调控政策出现重大转折的信
号，房地产政策不再仅是遏制房价过快上涨。8月25日，住房和城乡建设部、中
国人民银行、国家金融监督管理总局联合印发了《关于优化个人住房贷款中住房
套数认定标准的通知》，“认房不认贷”政策正式落地。该政策有利于居民换房行
为，有利于改善型需求的释放。8月31日，中国人民银行、国家金融监督管理总
局发布《关于调整优化差别化住房信贷政策的通知》，降低首付比例和按揭利率。
处置房地产开发企业的债务风险是 2023 年房地产行业的重要工作。9 月 28
日，中国恒大发布公告称，公司董事会主席许家印因涉嫌违法犯罪，已被依法采
取强制措施。此事件在市场引起强烈关注，这意味着房地产市场的风险处置关系
进入了新的阶段。
随着房地产行业进入深度调整，房地产行业的上市公司经营状况出现恶化，
有些上市公司不再符合交易所的标准。2023 年，A 股有 9 家房地产行业的上市
5
公司被强制退市，占沪深两市场退市总数的近四分之一。被退市的9家房地产行
业上市公司债务合计近10000亿元，它们在市值巅峰时的总市值超过4000亿元。

（四）新股发行速度暂缓，“壳价值”升温
截至 2023 年 12 月，我国有 313 只新股发行上市，融资金额 3565.59 亿元，
四个季度的融资金额分别为 650.79 亿元、1445.99 亿元、1139.76 亿元和 329.05
亿元。2023年前三季度的新股发行与2022年同期基本保持一致节奏，从三季度
开始新股发行速度放缓，三季度全市场有91只新股发行，四季度有49只新股上
市，融资规模相较三季度骤降约800亿元。为了稳定股票二级市场的价格，监管
部门出台政策，暂缓新股发行。
2023年发行的新股中有88只跌破发行价，破发比例约30%左右。其中，下
跌幅度超过30%的有11只，只有1只新股下跌幅度超过50%。其余225只股票
没有跌破发行价，但溢价超过30%的只有148只。
新股上市溢价的总体趋势是下行的，但不同阶段也出现过波动。2021 年曾
经出现过新股发行定价过低的现象，新股定价一度出现比较严重的“抱团压价”
现象，估值中枢节节下行。2021年9月，沪深交易所进一步优化新股定价机制，
使“抱团压价”现象得到实质性扭转，新股发行估值出现明显上行。与之相伴的
是，新股破发比例大幅提高。可以看到，2020年和2021年上市新股在当年的涨
幅中位数分别为-8.46%、-9.97%。2022年上市新股在当年的涨幅中位数开始回升，
6
达到-1.20%，2023年上市新股在当年的涨幅中位数为25.84%。
新股发行节奏的改变对股价结构产生了较大影响。2023 年 9 月之后，新股
暂缓发行使“壳价值”出现明显发弹，直接引发了四季度北交所的行情。
（五）北交所交易日趋活跃，三足鼎立格局初步形成
北京证券交易所于 2021 年 9 月 3 日注册成立，是经国务院批准设立的中国
第一家公司制证券交易所，是我国第三家证券交易所。北交所的设立标志着中国
资本市场三足鼎立格局的形成。
北交所的开户门槛初设为 50 万元，投资者数量受到限制，市场流动性不足
是制约北交所的核心问题。自成立以来，日成交额均在10亿元上下，但从2023
年10月末开始，北交所的日成交额逐渐增加，11月末突然放大至100亿元以上。
2023 年北证 50 指数收于 1082 点，该指数在 2023 年的低点是 706 点（10 月 24
日），一个多月时间里指数反弹了53%。
在交易活跃度增加的影响下，北交所的开户数量快速增加。截至2023年11
月22日，北交所合格投资者数量已达626万户，相较于2023年9月1日北交所
《深改19条》推出以来，新增近70万户。
2023年11月23日，易方达、华夏、广发、南方、嘉实、汇添富、大成、万
家基金旗下共计8只北交所两年定开混合基金的封闭式结束在即。据相关数据统
计，截至 2023 年 11 月 21 日，首批 8 只北交所主题基金成立至今的收益回报率
均告负，平均收益率收跌22.08%。

图 5 上市公司“壳价值”走势
数据来源：Wind，“壳价值”是每年沪深两市场中市值最小的100只股票加
权平均的结果。
7
北交所的活跃并非孤立事件，与新股发行暂缓有直接关系。从 A 股的历史
经验来看，每当新股发行暂缓或暂停，“壳价值”必然快速升温。图5显示，2014
年新股曾经有一年多的时间暂停发行，当时每只股票的“壳价值”高达 40 亿元
左右，即一个没有如何现金流收入的公司可以卖出40亿元的价格。2019年开始，
随着注册制改革的快速推进，“壳价值”出现贬值趋势。2022年，每只股票的“壳
价值”大约为10亿元左右。2023年9月之后，新股发行暂缓，“壳价值”再度升
温。北交所的上市公司以“专、精、特、新”企业为主，公司规模均较小，每股
对应的“壳价值”比主板高，因此，北交所股票对“壳价值”的波动更加敏感。
为了更好地说明新股发行暂缓与“壳价值”之间的波动关系，我们把沪深两
个市场进行了分组统计，结果是 2023 年小市值的股票出现大幅度上涨，与北交
所行情一致。

（六）基金收益欠佳，公募基金权益类资产扩张受阻
2023 年股票型基金和混合型基金份额净值表现截然不同。其中，混合型基
金整体出现亏损，尤其是三季度和四季度基金亏损净值加快；股票型基金份额则
逆势走高。
2023 年 A 股市场主要类型基金的平均收益率不佳。股票型基金净值普遍下
跌，混合型基金中的偏股混合型基金跌幅居前，平衡混合型和偏债混合型基金跌
幅不大，QDII 基金表现一枝独秀（见图6）。

二、2024 年市场展望
在过去一年里，我们一直强调国内房地产政策和美联储的货币政策对股市的
影响，伴随着美联储加息进程的不断进行，这两个因素分别在 2023 年三季度和
四季度出现边际改善。
（一）制约股市运行的外部因素出现边际改善，但需警惕美国的物价反弹
美国的 10 年期国债到期收益率是全球资产定价之锚，中美利差影响股市的
资金流动，这是美国货币政策影响中国股市的基本逻辑。
根据美联储2023年12月份会议的信息，美联储决定12月仍放缓加息步伐，
将联邦基金利率目标区间继续维持在5.25%至5.50%之间。市场一致认为，美联
储加息周期或将结束，降息通道也将在未来缓慢打开，随着美国长期国债的收益
率出现快速下降，10 年期国债到期收益率下行至 4%左右，比最高点下降了 100
个基点。
我们认为，美国控制通胀并非易事，2024 年美国物价反弹的概率相当大。
2023 年四季度，美国消费物价回落得益于石油价格从每桶 90 美元下跌到 70 美
元，下跌幅度超过20%。石油价格的下跌与美国石油出口量的增加直接相关，对
冲了其他产油国降低石油出口试图维护油价的努力。
从需求的角度看，美国股市主要指数均创历史新高，股票市值的大幅度增加
使美国的财富水涨船高，购买力也随之增强，增加了控制物价的难度。在 70 年
代，美国曾经有过物价几度反复的教训，出现了所谓“滞涨”现象。如果物价出
现反弹，美联储必然会采取措施，对股市产生不利影响。
9
（二）影响股市运行的国内主要因素仍然是房地产市场
房地产市场复苏的程度决定着股市反弹的高度和方向。尽管房地产政策拐点
已经出现，但是目前房地产市场形势仍然不容乐观。
中央金融工作会议强调，促进金融与房地产良性循环，健... (内容过长，已截断)',

一、2023 年度股市运行回顾
（一）全球主要股市上涨，A 股主要指数继续调整
2023 年全球主要股指均呈现不同程度上涨，A 股表现欠佳。我国主要股指
跌幅差别较大，其中，上证综合指数下跌3.70%，沪深300指数下跌11.38%，深
证成份股指数下跌13.54%，创业板指数下跌19.41%；香港恒生指数下跌13.82%。
同期，美国道琼斯指数上涨13.70%，纳斯达克指数上涨43.42%（见图1）。

美国纳斯达克指数领跑全球。主导美股年度表现的是以苹果、微软、谷歌等
为代表的龙头科技公司，这些公司年度涨幅基本都在 50%左右，其中，英伟达
（NVIDIA）上涨幅度超过200%。而这些龙头科技公司股价大幅上涨，主要原因
是2023年年初以“ChatGPT”为首的人工智能技术的横空出世。
高科技股的追捧热潮在A股市场也有所表现。从行业指数看，2023年A 股
涨幅最大的行业分别是通信、传媒、煤炭、电子、计算机、家用电器、汽车（见
图 2）。通信、传媒、电子、计算机行业指数的表现与人工智能技术突破有关。
2023年度上涨幅度最大的20只股票几乎全部为“人工智能”概念股票，如此极
端的走势十分少见，似乎也预示着该板块的风险正在来临。

美容护理、商贸零售、电力设备、房地产等行业则全年领跌。在 2023 年度
下跌幅度最大的 20 只股票中，新能源行业股票占据半壁江山。过去几年，中国
在新能源电池和新能源汽车行业取得了局部领先的优势，相关上市公司的业绩表
现优异，众多资金跟风推高了这些公司的估值。宁德时代和比亚迪等新能源电池
和新能源汽车行业的代表，股票价格在2020年之后大幅度上涨（见图3），而2023
年该板块的股票均出现较大幅度的回落，有些股票下跌幅度已超过50%。

（二）美联储快速加息对股市冲击巨大
美联储不断超预期的加息对中国股市产生了巨大影响。2023 年第四季度，
美国 10 年期国债到期收益率最高上升至 5%左右，我国 10 年期国债到期收益率
基本徘徊在2.7%左右，比美国10年期国债到期收益率低200余个基点。中美国
债到期收益率倒挂导致我国资金外流。可以直接观察到的现象是，每当美国 10
年期国债到期收益率上升，则美元走强，“北向资金”流出、人民币兑美元汇率
贬值，结果是A股走弱。2023年8月至2023年末，陆港通渠道资金一直是净流
出状态。其中，8月净流出896.83亿元，创两年来单月净流出记录（见表3）。

外资的流出并没有影响内资的加杠杆行为。2023 年，融资余额增加了 1300
亿元。在股指持续下跌的背景下，融资余额却不断增加，出现逆势加杠杆现象。
外资与内资截然相反的行为在A股历史上应该是第一次出现。

（三）房地产行业处于深度调整中，相关产业链的股票表现均受到影响
2023 年一季度，房地产市场出现逐月回升的“小阳春”，但是从 4 月以后，
房地产市场的交易量出现疲态。7月底的中央政治局会议明确提出“房地产市场
供求关系发生重大变化”，市场普遍认为这是房地产调控政策出现重大转折的信
号，房地产政策不再仅是遏制房价过快上涨。8月25日，住房和城乡建设部、中
国人民银行、国家金融监督管理总局联合印发了《关于优化个人住房贷款中住房
套数认定标准的通知》，“认房不认贷”政策正式落地。该政策有利于居民换房行
为，有利于改善型需求的释放。8月31日，中国人民银行、国家金融监督管理总
局发布《关于调整优化差别化住房信贷政策的通知》，降低首付比例和按揭利率。
处置房地产开发企业的债务风险是 2023 年房地产行业的重要工作。9 月 28
日，中国恒大发布公告称，公司董事会主席许家印因涉嫌违法犯罪，已被依法采
取强制措施。此事件在市场引起强烈关注，这意味着房地产市场的风险处置关系
进入了新的阶段。
随着房地产行业进入深度调整，房地产行业的上市公司经营状况出现恶化，
有些上市公司不再符合交易所的标准。2023 年，A 股有 9 家房地产行业的上市
5
公司被强制退市，占沪深两市场退市总数的近四分之一。被退市的9家房地产行
业上市公司债务合计近10000亿元，它们在市值巅峰时的总市值超过4000亿元。

（四）新股发行速度暂缓，“壳价值”升温
截至 2023 年 12 月，我国有 313 只新股发行上市，融资金额 3565.59 亿元，
四个季度的融资金额分别为 650.79 亿元、1445.99 亿元、1139.76 亿元和 329.05
亿元。2023年前三季度的新股发行与2022年同期基本保持一致节奏，从三季度
开始新股发行速度放缓，三季度全市场有91只新股发行，四季度有49只新股上
市，融资规模相较三季度骤降约800亿元。为了稳定股票二级市场的价格，监管
部门出台政策，暂缓新股发行。
2023年发行的新股中有88只跌破发行价，破发比例约30%左右。其中，下
跌幅度超过30%的有11只，只有1只新股下跌幅度超过50%。其余225只股票
没有跌破发行价，但溢价超过30%的只有148只。
新股上市溢价的总体趋势是下行的，但不同阶段也出现过波动。2021 年曾
经出现过新股发行定价过低的现象，新股定价一度出现比较严重的“抱团压价”
现象，估值中枢节节下行。2021年9月，沪深交易所进一步优化新股定价机制，
使“抱团压价”现象得到实质性扭转，新股发行估值出现明显上行。与之相伴的
是，新股破发比例大幅提高。可以看到，2020年和2021年上市新股在当年的涨
幅中位数分别为-8.46%、-9.97%。2022年上市新股在当年的涨幅中位数开始回升，
6
达到-1.20%，2023年上市新股在当年的涨幅中位数为25.84%。
新股发行节奏的改变对股价结构产生了较大影响。2023 年 9 月之后，新股
暂缓发行使“壳价值”出现明显发弹，直接引发了四季度北交所的行情。
（五）北交所交易日趋活跃，三足鼎立格局初步形成
北京证券交易所于 2021 年 9 月 3 日注册成立，是经国务院批准设立的中国
第一家公司制证券交易所，是我国第三家证券交易所。北交所的设立标志着中国
资本市场三足鼎立格局的形成。
北交所的开户门槛初设为 50 万元，投资者数量受到限制，市场流动性不足
是制约北交所的核心问题。自成立以来，日成交额均在10亿元上下，但从2023
年10月末开始，北交所的日成交额逐渐增加，11月末突然放大至100亿元以上。
2023 年北证 50 指数收于 1082 点，该指数在 2023 年的低点是 706 点（10 月 24
日），一个多月时间里指数反弹了53%。
在交易活跃度增加的影响下，北交所的开户数量快速增加。截至2023年11
月22日，北交所合格投资者数量已达626万户，相较于2023年9月1日北交所
《深改19条》推出以来，新增近70万户。
2023年11月23日，易方达、华夏、广发、南方、嘉实、汇添富、大成、万
家基金旗下共计8只北交所两年定开混合基金的封闭式结束在即。据相关数据统
计，截至 2023 年 11 月 21 日，首批 8 只北交所主题基金成立至今的收益回报率
均告负，平均收益率收跌22.08%。

图 5 上市公司“壳价值”走势
数据来源：Wind，“壳价值”是每年沪深两市场中市值最小的100只股票加
权平均的结果。
7
北交所的活跃并非孤立事件，与新股发行暂缓有直接关系。从 A 股的历史
经验来看，每当新股发行暂缓或暂停，“壳价值”必然快速升温。图5显示，2014
年新股曾经有一年多的时间暂停发行，当时每只股票的“壳价值”高达 40 亿元
左右，即一个没有如何现金流收入的公司可以卖出40亿元的价格。2019年开始，
随着注册制改革的快速推进，“壳价值”出现贬值趋势。2022年，每只股票的“壳
价值”大约为10亿元左右。2023年9月之后，新股发行暂缓，“壳价值”再度升
温。北交所的上市公司以“专、精、特、新”企业为主，公司规模均较小，每股
对应的“壳价值”比主板高，因此，北交所股票对“壳价值”的波动更加敏感。
为了更好地说明新股发行暂缓与“壳价值”之间的波动关系，我们把沪深两
个市场进行了分组统计，结果是 2023 年小市值的股票出现大幅度上涨，与北交
所行情一致。

（六）基金收益欠佳，公募基金权益类资产扩张受阻
2023 年股票型基金和混合型基金份额净值表现截然不同。其中，混合型基
金整体出现亏损，尤其是三季度和四季度基金亏损净值加快；股票型基金份额则
逆势走高。
2023 年 A 股市场主要类型基金的平均收益率不佳。股票型基金净值普遍下
跌，混合型基金中的偏股混合型基金跌幅居前，平衡混合型和偏债混合型基金跌
幅不大，QDII 基金表现一枝独秀（见图6）。

二、2024 年市场展望
在过去一年里，我们一直强调国内房地产政策和美联储的货币政策对股市的
影响，伴随着美联储加息进程的不断进行，这两个因素分别在 2023 年三季度和
四季度出现边际改善。
（一）制约股市运行的外部因素出现边际改善，但需警惕美国的物价反弹
美国的 10 年期国债到期收益率是全球资产定价之锚，中美利差影响股市的
资金流动，这是美国货币政策影响中国股市的基本逻辑。
根据美联储2023年12月份会议的信息，美联储决定12月仍放缓加息步伐，
将联邦基金利率目标区间继续维持在5.25%至5.50%之间。市场一致认为，美联
储加息周期或将结束，降息通道也将在未来缓慢打开，随着美国长期国债的收益

上海租赁住房特征呈现大基数客群&常态化需求
上海市租赁人口中，户籍人口占10%，非户籍人口占85%，主要受到工作的带动，流动性高。从静态数据来看，十年以上外来
人口留存率仅1/3。在上海持续吸引外来人口的背景下，租赁行为对于大基数的流入人口来说是一种常态化现象

上海租赁住房客群差异化推动产品多样化

上海租赁住房市场交易总额约900亿元/年
按照七普的实际数据，上海城镇约有290万户的租赁家庭，创造了总计约每年900亿左右的租金价值。此外，中介市场作为配套
服务，根据年交易量粗略估算，佣金规模约在20-30亿/年。由于租赁需求的极度下沉，少数中高端客群创造了绝大部分交易和
租赁价值，导致机构市场关注度向高端倾斜

上海集中式公寓供应结构以及区域结构
总体来看，集中式供应的分布是偏态且长尾的。有两个供应高峰：10000-30000元之间的产品及2000-5000元之间的产品。
按照环线来看，越优越的地段，产品局限性越小，而越外围的地段，项目的定位范围也相对越窄

上海集中式公寓总结
从运营角度来看，公寓的空间利用价值，与总价有关：越高端，每一单元空间产生的价值就越高；越高端，每一户所使用的单
元空间越大。整体来看，国企聚焦中高端市场，租赁市场压舱石目的基本达成，需要注意的是，当运营者与业主存在一致性，
有利有弊，从中长期来看，资产的持有方与运营方分化是较为普遍性的规律

上海租赁住房特征呈现大基数客群&常态化需求
上海市租赁人口中，户籍人口占10%，非户籍人口占85%，主要受到工作的带动，流动性高。从静态数据来看，十年以上外来
人口留存率仅1/3。在上海持续吸引外来人口的背景下，租赁行为对于大基数的流入人口来说是一种常态化现象

上海集中式公寓供应结构以及区域结构
总体来看，集中式供应的分布是偏态且长尾的。有两个供应高峰：10000-30000元之间的产品及2000-5000元之间的产品。
按照环线来看，越优越的地段，产品局限性越小，而越外围的地段，项目的定位范围也相对越窄

从运营角度来看，公寓的空间利用价值，与总价有关：越高端，每一单元空间产生的价值就越高；越高端，每一户所使用的单
元空间越大。整体来看，国企聚焦中高端市场，租赁市场压舱石目的基本达成，需要注意的是，当运营者与业主存在一致性，
有利有弊，从中长期来看，资产的持有方与运营方分化是较为普遍性的规律

Executive Summary
Public procurement is at the intersection between the public and the private sectors. On one
hand, relying on the private sector for the provision of certain goods and services can enhance
efficiency; on the other public procurement can be a strategic tool to sustain firms’ growth both in
the short and in the long term. Policy makers and practitioners are increasingly paying attention
to the potential catalytic role of public procurement to promote economic growth and inclusive
and sustainable development, for example through participation of SMEs and women-owned
firms in this market.
To sustain evidence-based policies in public procurement, firm-level survey data can be
a valuable source of information on public procurement market. In particular, it can capture
dimensions such as views and perceptions of firms that cannot be observed from e-government
procurement data, it allows to study firms that never entered the public procurement market, and
it provides data for countries that have not adopted an eGP system yet.
First, this paper provides guidance on how to design a high-quality firm-level survey to study
public procurement from the perspective of firms. The first set of decisions is on the target
population: whether all firms in the private sector should be invited to participate in the survey,
or only firms with some previous experience in public procurement. The second set of decisions
is on the sampling design, which is critical to ensure that the (weighted) statistics from the
firm-level survey data, such as the percentage of firms participating in public procurement, are
accurate estimates of the real conditions of the private sector. The third set of decisions is on
the mode of data collection, which should be informed by the specific country context and the
cost implications.
Second, this paper presents some of the statistics and stylized facts that can be generated
on public procurement from the existing World Bank Enterprise Surveys data, covering more
than 150 countries worldwide. The participation rate of private firms in public procurement is 18
percent, and small firms are 12 percentage points less likely to participate in public procurement
than larger firms. Globally, 21 percent of firms that secured or attempted to secure at least one
government contract in the 12 months prior to the interview state that firms similar to theirs
typically make informal payments or give gifts to secure government contracts. A procurement
questionnaire module piloted in Croatia, Poland, and Romania in the period May–June 2021
shows that, in these countries, administrative barriers before contract signature are the biggest
obstacle to attempting to secure a government contract, in particular the amount of effort required
for bid preparation and the length of the process after bid submission.
Together with legislative and institutional reviews, and the analysis of transactional procurement
data, firm-level survey data can be used to identify weaknesses of a public procurement system
and inform reform efforts. The World Bank Enterprise Surveys microdata are publicly available
for research and analytical studies, and the World Bank is continuing expanding its effort to
generate global data on public procurement.

I. Introduction and background
Phone interviewing opens new possibilities for empirical research in social sciences. It greatly reduces the costs
of conducting surveys because all communication occurs without the face-to-face interaction customary in
traditional surveys. With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic limiting face-to-face interviews, phone
surveys are more prevalent among academic institutions, survey companies, and individual researchers for
individual-level and household-level data collection. To track households’ living conditions on a timely basis
during a pandemic, the World Bank launched the COVID-19 High-Frequency Phone Surveys (HFPS), which
have been carried out in around 80 countries since March 2020. These surveys allow policy makers to monitor
a wide variety of socioeconomic indicators in a timely and frequent manner.
Phone surveys have shortcomings. First, it is difficult to monitor poverty using the COVID-19 HFPS. The
COVID-19 HFPS does not collect consumption or income data, which are necessary for measuring poverty
and inequality under the traditional poverty monitoring approach. It is time-consuming, costly, and complex to
collect such data. An interviewer must ask households a number of complex questions regarding their recent
consumption, expenditures, and detailed income components. Such an interview requires at least 30 minutes
and up to two hours, even by well-trained and qualified interviewers. It is also challenging to administer the
interview in developing countries where telephone connections are not always stable enough to complete such
a long interview.
A solution to Challenge 1: SWIFT as a rapid poverty monitoring tool
In March 2020, the World Bank launched a pilot for the use of a rapid poverty monitoring tool, Survey of
Wellbeing via Instant, Frequent Tracking (SWIFT), to estimate monetary poverty using the COVID-19 HFPS.
SWIFT adds 10 to 15 simple questions to the COVID-19 HFPS questionnaire, and these additional questions
take 3 to 5 minutes to ask. Based on households’ responses to these questions, the SWIFT method can be
adopted to impute poverty and inequality rates among the population of interest.
SWIFT was chosen among many poverty projection methodologies because it has been thoroughly tested and
reviewed by experts inside and outside the World Bank. The results are encouraging – the difference between
the true and SWIFT-based poverty projections is 1.2 percentage points on average and is within +/- 2
percentage points, except for one case (see more details in Appendix 5 or Yoshida et al., 2022a). The pilot was
conducted in 20 countries around the world, and the results of seven countries are summarized in Yoshida et
al. (2022b).
Second, the sample of the COVID-19 HFPS is unlikely to be nationally representative. In many developing
countries, the coverage of mobile phones or land lines is limited. Poor households that do not own a phone
are excluded from phone interviews. In addition, phone interviews usually face a much higher rate of
nonresponse than in-person interviews. Such nonresponses are usually concentrated among urban residents
who are too busy to participate in the interviews. Hence, the sample collected in a phone survey is often far
from nationally representative and can result in bias in the projections of poverty.
A solution to Challenge 2: Reweighting – sampling weight adjustments to address sampling biases
Many approaches for adjusting sampling weights, or “reweighting,” have been developed to correct for various
types of sampling bias. This paper classifies them into two major categories: (1) propensity score weighting
(PSW) and (2) “non-PSW adjustments.”
Propensity score weighting is a method for adjusting sampling weights based on propensity scores and was
developed from the propensity score matching proposed by Rubin and Rosenbaum (1983 and 1984). In the
context of causal inferences, propensity score matching makes the control and treatment groups comparable,
minimizing bias in estimating treatment effects. Unless the samples of the control and treatment groups are
selected randomly (which is usually not the case with observational data), baseline characteristics may exhibit
2
differences between the two groups. Propensity scores are often estimated to address this issue of non-
comparability. A propensity score is the probability of selecting a sample household or individual into the
treatment group from the population, conditional on covariates. If a set of assumptions is satisfied (see
Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983 and 1984 for details), a comparison of the weighted average of the outcome
indicators between the control and treatment groups provides an unbiased estimate for the treatment effect.
Taylor (2000) and Lee (2006) adopted the propensity score matching technique to adjust sampling weights and
correct for sampling bias in a web survey. First, they chose a reference survey representative of the population
of interest (e.g., the entire population of a country, the urban population, or all refugees in a country). They
combined the reference and web surveys and estimated propensity scores using this combined sample. They
then divided the combined sample into quintiles based on the propensity scores and adjusted the sampling
weights of the web survey to equate the sum of the weights of the web survey with those of the reference
survey in each quintile.
Another type of propensity score weighting method is “inverse probability approach,” which uses propensity
scores to construct the odds of a sample being selected for a reference survey, and the odds are further used as
a sampling weight of a web or phone survey (Morgan and Todd 2008, Schafer and Kang 2008, and Austin
2011). This paper classifies these types of reweighting techniques based on propensity scores as Propensity
Score Weighting (PSW) methods. If the assumptions in Rubin and Rosembaum (1983 and 1984) are satisf... (内容过长，已截断)',

I. Introduction and background
Phone interviewing opens new possibilities for empirical research in social sciences. It greatly reduces the costs
of conducting surveys because all communication occurs without the face-to-face interaction customary in
traditional surveys. With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic limiting face-to-face interviews, phone
surveys are more prevalent among academic institutions, survey companies, and individual researchers for
individual-level and household-level data collection. To track households’ living conditions on a timely basis
during a pandemic, the World Bank launched the COVID-19 High-Frequency Phone Surveys (HFPS), which
have been carried out in around 80 countries since March 2020. These surveys allow policy makers to monitor
a wide variety of socioeconomic indicators in a timely and frequent manner.
Phone surveys have shortcomings. First, it is difficult to monitor poverty using the COVID-19 HFPS. The
COVID-19 HFPS does not collect consumption or income data, which are necessary for measuring poverty
and inequality under the traditional poverty monitoring approach. It is time-consuming, costly, and complex to
collect such data. An interviewer must ask households a number of complex questions regarding their recent
consumption, expenditures, and detailed income components. Such an interview requires at least 30 minutes
and up to two hours, even by well-trained and qualified interviewers. It is also challenging to administer the
interview in developing countries where telephone connections are not always stable enough to complete such
a long interview.
A solution to Challenge 1: SWIFT as a rapid poverty monitoring tool
In March 2020, the World Bank launched a pilot for the use of a rapid poverty monitoring tool, Survey of
Wellbeing via Instant, Frequent Tracking (SWIFT), to estimate monetary poverty using the COVID-19 HFPS.
SWIFT adds 10 to 15 simple questions to the COVID-19 HFPS questionnaire, and these additional questions
take 3 to 5 minutes to ask. Based on households’ responses to these questions, the SWIFT method can be
adopted to impute poverty and inequality rates among the population of interest.
SWIFT was chosen among many poverty projection methodologies because it has been thoroughly tested and
reviewed by experts inside and outside the World Bank. The results are encouraging – the difference between
the true and SWIFT-based poverty projections is 1.2 percentage points on average and is within +/- 2
percentage points, except for one case (see more details in Appendix 5 or Yoshida et al., 2022a). The pilot was
conducted in 20 countries around the world, and the results of seven countries are summarized in Yoshida et
al. (2022b).
Second, the sample of the COVID-19 HFPS is unlikely to be nationally representative. In many developing
countries, the coverage of mobile phones or land lines is limited. Poor households that do not own a phone
are excluded from phone interviews. In addition, phone interviews usually face a much higher rate of
nonresponse than in-person interviews. Such nonresponses are usually concentrated among urban residents
who are too busy to participate in the interviews. Hence, the sample collected in a phone survey is often far
from nationally representative and can result in bias in the projections of poverty.
A solution to Challenge 2: Reweighting – sampling weight adjustments to address sampling biases
Many approaches for adjusting sampling weights, or “reweighting,” have been developed to correct for various
types of sampling bias. This paper classifies them into two major categories: (1) propensity score weighting
(PSW) and (2) “non-PSW adjustments.”
Propensity score weighting is a method for adjusting sampling weights based on propensity scores and was
developed from the propensity score matching proposed by Rubin and Rosenbaum (1983 and 1984). In the
context of causal inferences, propensity score matching makes the control and treatment groups comparable,
minimizing bias in estimating treatment effects. Unless the samples of the control and treatment groups are
selected randomly (which is usually not the case with observational data), baseline characteristics may exhibit
2
differences between the two groups. Propensity scores are often estimated to address this issue of non-
comparability. A propensity score is the probability of selecting a sample household or individual into the
treatment group from the population, conditional on covariates. If a set of assumptions is satisfied (see
Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983 and 1984 for details), a comparison of the weighted average of the outcome
indicators between the control and treatment groups provides an unbiased estimate for the treatment effect.
Taylor (2000) and Lee (2006) adopted the propensity score matching technique to adjust sampling weights and
correct for sampling bias in a web survey. First, they chose a reference survey representative of the population
of interest (e.g., the entire population of a country, the urban population, or all refugees in a country). They
